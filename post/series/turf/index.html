Turf
A four- issue hard boiled noir crime thriller with girls, guns, fangs and aliens. New York, 1929. The height of prohibition. The cops turn a blind eye while the mobs run the city, dealing in guns, girls and illegal liquor. But the arrival of the mysterious Dragonmir Family from Eastern Europe with more of a taste for blood then booze co-incides with a series of brutal attacks on the gangsters themselves. As the gangs fall before the fangs, only handful of mobsters survive. But an unlikely alliance formed between tough guy Eddie Falco and a character from a LONG way from New York City - a long way from Earth in fact - offers the humans a glimmer of hope. As the strong willed young reporter Susie Dale from the Gotham Herald tries to survive in the middle of the maelstrom, and an ancient prophecy unfolds, no one can guess who&amp;rsquo;s going to win the battle for this particular slice of Turf. RETAILER WARNING: MAY NOT BE SUITABLE FOR ALL AGES The Creators JONATHAN ROSS is one of the highest profile broadcasters in the UK. His weekly talk show, Friday Night with Jonathan Ross is entering its 11th year on BBC1, and is the UK&amp;rsquo;s most successful comedy talk show.

He also hosts an award winning weekly radio show, the BBC&amp;rsquo;s flagship Film review program and the Bafta Film Awards, which is shown in numerous countries around the world. In a career that spans over twenty years Ross has often been associated with cult entertainment. His award winning series The Incredibly Strange Film Show and it&amp;rsquo;s sequel, The Son of the Incredibly Strange Film Show won a fan following that remembers them fondly to this day. He was responsible for the first western television interview with Jacki Chan, Tsui Hark and many other leading Hong Kong stars. He has authored programs on subjects as diverse as Korean Cinema, Drive-Through Funeral parlors in Louisiana and Steve Ditko.

Edwards created the licensing style-guides for films such as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&amp;rsquo;s Stone, Men in Black II, Superman Returns, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and Batman Begins.
