&lt;p&gt;Tall Tales&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tall Tales was an innovative newspaper strip syndicated internationally by the New York Herald Tribune from 1957-1963. Whereas newspaper strips are square, single-panel or multiple-panel horizontal gag cartoons, Al Jaffee, known for the Fold-In in MAD Magazine, once again altered the format of his work to create a vertical strip-the first, and last, in newspaper history. Tall Tales contains the best 120 wordless strips out of over 2,200, scanned from the original files. The book features a new preface by Jaffee and an introduction by Stephen Colbert of The Colbert Report.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;How to Fake a Moon Landing: Exposing the Myths of Science Denial&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is hydro-fracking safe? Is climate change real? Did the moon landing actually happen? How about evolution: fact or fiction? Author-illustrator Darryl Cunningham looks at these and other hot-button science topics and presents a fact-based, visual assessment of current thinking and research on eight different issues everybody&amp;rsquo;s arguing about. His lively storytelling approach incorporates comics, photographs, and diagrams to create substantive but easily accessible reportage. Cunningham&amp;rsquo;s distinctive illustrative style shows how information is manipulated by all sides; his easy-to-follow narratives allow readers to draw their own fact-based conclusions. A graphic milestone of investigative journalism!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Yiddishkeit Jewish Vernacular &amp;amp; the New Land&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yiddish is everywhere. We hear words like nosh, schlep, and schmutz all the time, but how did these words come to pepper American English? In Yiddishkeit: Jewish Vernacular and the New Land, Harvey Pekar and Paul Buhle trace the influence of Yiddish from medieval Europe to the tenements of New York&amp;rsquo;s Lower East Side. This comics anthology contains original stories by notable writers and artists such as Barry Deutsch, Peter Kuper, Spain Rodriguez, and Sharon Rudahl. Through illustrations, comics art, and a full-length play, four major themes are explored: culture, performance, assimilation, and the revival of the language. The last fully realized work by Harvey Pekar, this book is a thoughtful compilation that reveals the far-reaching influences of Yiddish.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Si Lewen&amp;rsquo;s Parade: An Artist&amp;rsquo;s Odyssey&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Si Lewen’s Parade is a timeless story told in a language that knows no country—a wordless epic that, despite its muteness, is more powerful than the written or the spoken word. First published in 1957, The Parade is a lost classic, newly discovered, remastered, and presented by Art Spiegelman, the Pulitzer Prize–winning author of Maus. Reproduced with an extensive overview of the artist’s career, The Parade is a celebration of art and the story of recurring war as Si Lewen experienced it over the past 90 years, watching the joyful parades that marked the end of World War I lead into the death marches of World War II and the Korean War. As The Parade unfolds, the reader is taken on an unforgettable journey of sequential images.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Nat Turner&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of Nat Turner and his slave rebellion-which began on August 21, 1831, in Southampton County, Virginia-is known among school children and adults. To some he is a hero, a symbol of Black resistance and a precursor to the civil rights movement; to others he is monster-a murderer whose name is never uttered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Nat Turner, acclaimed author and illustrator Kyle Baker depicts the evils of slavery in this moving and historically accurate story of Nat Turner&amp;rsquo;s slave rebellion. Told nearly wordlessly, every image resonates with the reader as the brutal story unfolds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This graphic novel collects all four issues of Kyle Baker&amp;rsquo;s critically acclaimed miniseries together for the first time in hardcover and paperback. The book also includes a new afterword by Baker.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Best We Could Do&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This beautifully illustrated and emotional story is an evocative memoir about the search for a better future and a longing for the past. Exploring the anguish of immigration and the lasting effects that displacement has on a child and her family, Bui documents the story of her family&amp;rsquo;s daring escape after the fall of South Vietnam in the 1970s, and the difficulties they faced building new lives for themselves. At the heart of Bui&amp;rsquo;s story is a universal struggle: While adjusting to life as a first-time mother, she ultimately discovers what it means to be a parent—the endless sacrifices, the unnoticed gestures, and the depths of unspoken love. Despite how impossible it seems to take on the simultaneous roles of both parent and child, Bui pushes through. With haunting, poetic writing and breathtaking art, she examines the strength of family, the importance of identity, and the meaning of home. In what Pulitzer Prize–winning novelist Viet Thanh Nguyen calls &amp;ldquo;a book to break your heart and heal it,&amp;rdquo; The Best We Could Do brings to life Thi Bui&amp;rsquo;s journey of understanding, and provides inspiration to all of those who search for a better future while longing for a simpler past.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Trashed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every week we pile our garbage on the curb and it disappears-like magic! The reality is anything but, of course. Trashed, Derf Backderf&amp;rsquo;s follow-up to the critically acclaimed, award-winning international bestseller My Friend Dahmer, is an ode to the crap job of all crap jobs-garbage collector. Anyone who has ever been trapped in a soul-sucking gig will relate to this tale. Trashed follows the raucous escapades of three 20-something friends as they clean the streets of pile after pile of stinking garbage, while battling annoying small-town bureaucrats, bizarre townfolk, sweltering summer heat, and frigid winter storms. Trashed is fiction, but is inspired by Derf&amp;rsquo;s own experiences as a garbage­man. Interspersed are nonfiction pages that detail what our garbage is and where it goes. The answers will stun you. Hop on the garbage truck named Betty and ride along with Derf on a journey into the vast, secret world of garbage. Trashed is a hilarious, stomach-churning tale that will leave you laughing and wincing in disbelief.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Just So Happens&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yumiko was born in Japan but has made a life in London, losing herself in its cosmopolitan bustle. She has a gallery show of her art, a good job, and a good guy she plans to marry. The culture she grew up in seems very far away-until her brother phones with the news that their father has died. Yumiko returns to Tokyo and finds herself immersed in the rituals of death while also plunged into the rituals of life-fish bars, bullet trains, pagodas-as she confronts the question of where her future really lies. Just So Happens deals both gently and powerfully with grief, identity, and the pressure not to disappoint one&amp;rsquo;s parents, even after they&amp;rsquo;re gone, in a look at the relationships that build the foundation of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Sing No Evil&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twenty-something guitarist Aksel stutters when he sings, and the latest reviews say he has the voice of a crow with throat plague. That’s not a compliment, even for the avant-garde music his band Perkeros plays. Aksel is having a hard time keeping the band together, stopping his girlfriend from kicking him out, and not getting eaten by his drummer (who happens to be a cranky brown bear). There are also the rival bands that Perkeros find themselves in battle with to save the city from supernatural forces set loose by ancient music. The key to it all could be in the music Aksel hears in his dreams—if it doesn’t drive him mad first. With a visual soundtrack that blasts off the page, Sing No Evil is a wild ride through otherworldly dangers and the power of pure rock’n’roll.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Whatever Happened To The World of Tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;209 pages!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spanning the period from the 1939 New York World&amp;rsquo;s Fair to the last Apollo space mission in 1975, it is told through the eyes of a boy as he grows up in an era that was optimistic and ambitious, fueled by industry, engines, electricity, rockets, and the atom bomb. An insightful look at relationships and the promise of the future, award-winning author Brian Fies presents his story in a way that only comics and graphic novels can. Interspersed with the comic book adventures of Commander Cap Crater (created by Fies to mirror the styles of the comics and the time periods he is depicting), and mixing art and historical photographs, this groundbreaking graphic novel is a lively trip through a half century of technological evolution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
