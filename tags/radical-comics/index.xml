&lt;p&gt;Shrapnel: Aristeia Rising&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humanity has a new empire. Our solar system has been colonized and each planet is dominated by the brutal will of the Solar Alliance. All except Venus, the last free colony and final relic of democracy! As Venus and its&amp;rsquo; people suffer the enforcement of the Alliance, one woman may be able to turn the tide. Samantha &amp;lsquo;Sam&amp;rsquo; Vijaya, a Solar Alliance war veteran and hero, lives on Venus in self-imposed exile, hoping to escape the life she once knew. However, when the skies burn and civil war comes to her doorstep, Sam has no choice but to join the fight. With the freedom of humanity on the brink of extinction, Sam must emerge from exile to destroy the same forces she once led! Created by Mark Long and best-selling science-fiction novelist Nick Sagan (Idlewild). Features covers by Clint Langley, Bruno Werneck, Bai, and Gerhard Moszi.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Ryder On the Storm&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the team that brought you FVZA, a new adventure brimming with elements of H.P. Lovecraft, mixed into a noir mystery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ryder on the Storm follows Ryder, a private eye hired by the beautiful femme fatale Katrina Petruska to investigate the horrifically bizarre suicide of her lover, Michael Hudson. Ryder&amp;rsquo;s journey to solve the case and finish Hudson&amp;rsquo;s work leads him to discover a truth more sinister and terrifying than he could ever have imagined - daemons walk among us. Now, he must team up with the last daemon hunter, Charles Monk, to take down the cabal of ancient evil controlling the city while struggling to reconcile the dark side of his own nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Dark&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guided by an amoral drifter, a crew of jaded mercenaries must travel into the dark places of the ruined planet, and the even darker places of their own pasts, on a journey to find a woman who might just save the world. But maybe the world is past saving. And maybe the people who still inhabit that world aren&amp;rsquo;t worth saving. After Dark is the story of hidden demons and the passion for survival, set in a future that could very well be ours.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Hercules: The Thracian Wars&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourteen hundred years ago, a tormented soul walked the earth that was neither man nor god. Hercules was the powerful son of the god king Zeus, for this he received nothing but suffering his entire life. After twelve arduous labors and the loss of his family, this dark, world-weary soul turned his back on the gods finding his only solace in bloody battle. Over the years he warmed to the company of six similar souls, their only bond being their love of fighting and presence of death. These men and woman never question where they go to fight or why or whom, just how much they will be paid. Now the King of Thrace has hired these mercenaries to train his men to become the greatest army of all time. It is time for this bunch of lost souls to finally have their eyes opened to how far they have fallen when they must train an army to become as ruthless and blood thirsty as their reputation has become.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
