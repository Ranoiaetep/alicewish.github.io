&lt;p&gt;The True Death of Billy the Kid&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being an authentic narrative of the final days in Billy the Kid&amp;rsquo;s brief and turbulent life.&amp;rsquo; One of our folk legends of the great Wild West, William H. Bonney went from cowboy and gunslinger for a rancher to pure outlawry forever dodging justice in New Mexico when it wasn&amp;rsquo;t even a state. On the one hand, he was charming, fun-loving –often at social events like dances-, quite appealing to the ladies. Also conversant in Spanish, &amp;ldquo;Billito&amp;rdquo; was popular with the Spanish speaking crowd. On the other hand, he had no compunction to coldly kill a man, a sheriff, a deputy, anyone who got in his way rustling cattle or horses for an illicit living. He also proved hard to keep in jail even when caught. It is probably his feats of derring-do escaping from jails that made him most famous and this is the main subject of this biography following him until he is shot in pitch darkness by lawmen obsessed with getting rid of him.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Monet, Itinerant of Light&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The life of the great French painter, one of the founders of Impressionism, is narrated in lush comic art reminiscent of his style. From the Salon des Refuses (&amp;ldquo;Salon of the Rejected&amp;rdquo;) and many struggling years without recognition, money and yet a family to raise, all the way to great success, critically and financially, Monet pursued insistently one vision: catching the light in painting, refusing to compromise on this ethereal pursuit. It cost him dearly but he was a beacon for his contemporaries. We discover in this comics biography how he came to this vision as well as his turbulent life pursuing it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Marie Antoinette, Phantom Queen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the 1930s, Maud, an artist, discovers she has a psychic gift. The first signs manifest themselves in the royal gardens of the Trianon where gradually she understands that a woman from the beyond is attempting to communicate with her. The revelation is beyond belief: it is the ghost of Marie Antoinette appearing to her to share a terrible secret that has tormented her for centuries. After being guillotined, the Queen is said to have been thrown into a common grave but then exhumed and buried with her husband, Louis XVI, in the Saint-Denis basilica. Yet the ghost tells Maud that her remains are still in the pit, on which a chapel stands today. The queen asks Maud to move her body to the right place so she can finally find peace and no longer haunt people.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Glenn Gould was a Canadian pianist, a child genius who became a worldwide superstar of classical music remembered for, among others, his almost revolutionary interpretations of Bach. This graphic novel biography seeks to understand the eccentric personality behind the persona. Who is the mysterious Glenn Gould? Why did he abruptly end his career as a performing musician? Why did he become one of the very first of his peers to disappear from the public eye like J.D. Salinger? Sandrine Revel delves into the life of Gould with hand painted illustrations and the viewpoint of an adoring fan.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Religion: A Discovery in Comics&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author of the bestselling Discovery in Comics series, including on Science and Philosophy, tackles a very sensitive subject. Dealing with religion often means walking on eggshells - that is what comic artist Margreet de Heer finds out in this book in which she presents the five major religions and modern spirituality in a colorful, personal yet serious manner. She explores religious history and practices with tact and an open mind, but can&amp;rsquo;t prevent a few eggs from breaking. Why is religion such a sensitive subject?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book in comics is fun and informative for believers, non-believers and everyone in between. It offers a fresh look from different perspectives on the phenomenon of religion, the backgrounds and history of the five major world religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism) and makes the point that religion is something that should unite us, not drive us apart.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Billie Holiday&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Born in Baltimore in 1915, and dead too early in New York in 1959, Billie Holiday became a legendary jazz singer, even mythical. With her voice even now managing to touch so many people, we follow a reporter on the trail of the artist on behalf of a New York daily. Beyond the public scandals that marred the life of the star (alcohol, drugs, violence&amp;hellip;), he seeks to restore the truth, revisiting the memory of Billie. Through this investigation, Muñoz and Sampayo trace, through the undertones of racism, and in the wake of the blues, the slow drift of a singer who expressed the deepest emotions in jazz. By internationally renowned Argentine artists, featuring Munoz&amp;rsquo; strikingly raw heavy blacks, this is not just a biography but a spell-binding art book tribute.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;A Treasury of Victorian Murder&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This second volume of Rick Geary&amp;rsquo;s Treasury of Victorian Murder explores the ghastliest and most famous murders of Victorian England. Rick has researched this book extensively and presents, with his own inimitable tongue-in-cheek style, the Jack The Ripper mystery as told through a journal of a fascinated Englishman of the day. Both factual and darkly funny, Geary&amp;rsquo;s personal take on this story shines an ironic light on the repressive society that spawned such a monster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Geary&amp;rsquo;s haunting drawings unite seamlessly with his moody, well-researched text.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash;Publishers Weekly&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Expertly designed and drawn.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash;Ellery Queen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equinoxes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an equinox, day is as long as night, as if the world found perfect equilibrium between shadow and light, a fleeting equilibrium, similar to the stakes of our human destinies. Segmented into four tableaux for four seasons, unrelated people of all social backgrounds seeking equilibrium cross paths with other solitudes, weaving in and out of one another&amp;rsquo;s lives- all captivated and tormented by the enigmatic meaning of life. Every season has its visual identity and its individual voice, culminating in summer and, possibly, an answer. Equinoxes is a unique ground-breaking work of rare intensity and narrative sensibility by a rising bestselling star of European comics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Thoreau, A Sublime Life&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;To be a philosopher is not merely to have subtle thoughts, nor even to found a school, but so to love wisdom as to live according to its dictates, a life of simplicity, independence, magnanimity and trust.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This graphic novel biography relates the forward looking inspirational life of the great author, philosopher and pioneering ecologist. Henry David Thoreau was also the father of the concept, still fresh today (viz &amp;lsquo;Occupy Wall St.&amp;rsquo;), of &amp;lsquo;civil disobedience&amp;rsquo; which he used against slavery and the encroachment of government.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Portugal&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the author of the acclaimed Equinoxes comes a return to roots that serves as spiritual renewal. Comics artist Simon Muchat is stuck. Suffering writer&amp;rsquo;s block, uninspired, vegetating as a school art teacher, he is losing direction and his taste for life, until one day he is invited to appear at a comics convention in Portugal, the country his family came from and which he hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen since his childhood. The experience proves cathartic. Even though he is not Portuguese himself and is a foreigner there, so many elements are familiar to him. Meeting its lively citizens, full of the zest for life, his distant yet welcoming family bringing back fond early memories, all prove reinvigorating, the breath of fresh air he so badly needed. Based on his own experience, Pedrosa narrates this return to his roots in a deeply compelling and warmly human way. This is his bestselling graphic novel with over 100,000 copies sold in France and a winner of many prizes including Best Graphic Novel at the Angouleme Festival and FNAC Best GN.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Spun around her actual brief meteoric career as a smoldering film actress who popularized bangs, Geary fantasizes about her coming back to her home town of Wichita where she becomes intrigued by a murder involving a friend, a famous reclusive writer and a shady beau. Not before she gets herself in great danger will she emerge with the solution the police fail to grasp!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Walking Wounded: Uncut Stories from Iraq&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For hundreds of thousands of young Americans, after the shock of &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;, there was Ar Ramadi, Baghdad, Abu Ghraib&amp;hellip; The war in Irak. Then came the trauma. Olivier Morel gave them a voice in his compelling documentary On the Bridge. Walking Wounded isn&amp;rsquo;t the book of the documentary but the story of Morel getting close to the young vets, their troubled experience and lives. So close he could not avoid living their trauma himself, seeing all too clearly their vision of the world after their gut-wrenching experiences. From torment to reflection, Morel and artist Mael relate through these vets the impossible return of those who do aspire vividly to get back to a normal life. The effort is huge, some can&amp;rsquo;t make it, others score their own victory by finally turning the corner&amp;hellip; a parable for our country&amp;rsquo;s war sickness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The Initiates&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Etienne Davodeau is a comic artist. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t know much about the world of wine-making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard Leroy is a wine-maker. He&amp;rsquo;s rarely even read comics. But these two are full of good will and curiosity. Why do we choose to spend one&amp;rsquo;s life writing and creating comics or producing wine? For more than a year, Etienne went to work in Richard&amp;rsquo;s vineyards and cellar. Richard, in return, leapt into the world of comics. They opened a lot of bottles and read many comics. They traveled around, meeting authors and wine-makers sharing their passion for their jobs. The Initiates explores the nature of a man&amp;rsquo;s vocation with a true life representation of it from two very different perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The Girl in Dior is Clara, a freshly hired chronicler, fan of fashion and our guide in the busy corridors of the brand new house of Christian Dior. It&amp;rsquo;s February 12, 1947 and the crème de la crème of Paris Haute Couture is flocking to the momentous event of Dior&amp;rsquo;s first show. In a flurry of corolla shaped skirts, the parade of models file down the runway. The audience is mesmerized: it&amp;rsquo;s a triumph! Carmel Snow of Harper&amp;rsquo;s Bazaar cries out: &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s quite a revolution, your dresses have such a new look!&amp;rdquo; Dior&amp;rsquo;s career is launched and Clara&amp;rsquo;s story begins.

Mark McGwire is racing Sammy Sosa to break the home run record, Bill Clinton is being questioned about a White House intern named Monica Lewinsky, Semisonic&amp;rsquo;s Closing Time is on top of the charts, and Carl Carter is leading the Elizabeth Monarchs of rural Vermont to the state championship in his senior year.
