&lt;p&gt;World Without End&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Millions of years in the future, a new world emerges — a world made of living flesh, surrounded by acidic seas. Rotten at the edges, awash in gangrene swamps, and bristling with mountains of bone, the planet&amp;rsquo;s simmering core houses the stark city of Bedlam, where an all-male race suppresses every manifestation of femininity. In this magnificently illustrated dreamscape of brutality and eroticism, a mysterious female presence called Rumour arises to challenge super-commando Brother Bones in a deadly war between the sexes. World Without End offers a compelling blend of science-fiction allegory and fantasy adventure. Author Jamie Delano&amp;rsquo;s unique vision of a strange, immersive world is perfectly complemented by John Higgins&amp;rsquo;s stunning illustrations. The epic tale was originally published by DC Comics as a six-part series. This edition is its first single-volume publication. Suggested for mature readers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Little Nemo in the Palace of Ice and Further Adventures&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these strange and marvelously drawn cartoons, a sleeping boy is transported to such fantastic worlds as the Palace of Ice, a pirate ship on the high seas, and a miniature city. Created by a pioneer of cartooning and animation, Little Nemo and his companions provided Sunday entertainment for readers of The New York Herald for nearly a decade. Nemo&amp;rsquo;s escapades swirl in classic dream imagery such as falls, flights, and forests swarming with wild beasts. This lavish hardcover volume recaptures the vintage cartoon&amp;rsquo;s incredibly baroque details and captivating weirdness with 31 full-color pages reproduced from the original 1907 editions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Little Tulip&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A serial killer haunts the city streets, a stalker of isolated women who leaves a Santa Claus hat at the scene of his crimes. Pavel, a Russian émigré, assists the police investigation as a sketch artist. But Pavel&amp;rsquo;s true calling is as a tattoo artist, and the so-called Bad Santa killings conjure up memories of the nightmarish world in which he learned his craft: a Russian prison camp that shattered his childhood and destroyed his family. Shifting between the living hell of a 1940s Siberian gulag and the crime-ridden chaos of New York City during the 1970s, this graphic novel&amp;rsquo;s stunning artwork provides an atmospheric backdrop to its tale of corruption, murder, and revenge.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The Boys of Sheriff Street&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid the tenements and riverfronts of the Lower East Side, twin brothers Max and Morris rule the seedy streets as chieftains of a crew of thieves and hoodlums. Tensions rise when a rival gang encroaches upon their Sheriff Street territory, leading to a wave of violence that threatens to develop into an all-out war. The setting becomes even more explosive when a femme fatale enters the scene and tests the brothers&amp;rsquo; loyalty to each other. With its moody, atmospheric images of New York City&amp;rsquo;s underworld during the 1930s, this graphic novel conjures up the timeless allure of film noir. The haunting illustrations are the work of French artist Jacques de Loustal, who is also a noted painter and graphic artist. This edition includes a series of the artist&amp;rsquo;s preliminary sketches. Author Jerome Charyn, hailed by New York Newsday as&amp;rdquo;a contemporary American Balzac,&amp;rdquo; provides a new introduction and translation for the tale, which was originally published in French. Suggested for mature readers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Fires &amp;amp; Murmur&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Created by Eisner Award-winning artist Lorenzo Mattotti, Fires sweeps readers off into a hypnotic, haunting fantasy centered on a mysterious island where the hills are constantly ablaze. A series of vessels have inexplicably disappeared from the vicinity, so the battleship Anselm II is dispatched to investigate. When the expedition&amp;rsquo;s leader, Lieutenant Absinthe, comes ashore, his encounter with the burning island&amp;rsquo;s bizarre residents results in a form of psychic possession that leads to mayhem, madness, and murder. Mattotti&amp;rsquo;s vivid illustrations, rendered with the depth and richness of paintings, propel the eye through a brooding, brilliantly colored atmosphere of mesmerizing imagery. A second tale by Mattotti, co-written with Jerry Kramsky, offers another fantastic voyage. Murmur traces an amnesiac&amp;rsquo;s quest across phantasmagoric landscapes to recover his identity — an enigmatic journey in which fear and confusion are resolved by arcane magic rituals. This handsome hardcover edition marks the first publication of Fires and Murmur in a single volume. Both stories were originally published in French; this Dover edition features the 1988 English translation of Feux (Fires) and the 1993 English translation of Murmure (Murmur) English translations.  Suggested for mature readers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
