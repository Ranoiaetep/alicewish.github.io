&lt;p&gt;Steve McQueen: Full Throttle Cool&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rediscover, or experience for the first time, the incredible life story of a true American icon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steve McQueen said, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure whether I&amp;rsquo;m an actor who races or a racer who acts.&amp;rdquo; Fortunately for us, he was the best of both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McQueen left an indelible imprint as one of Hollywood&amp;rsquo;s sexiest leading men. His masterful film roles in Bullitt, The Great Escape, The Thomas Crown Affair, and Papillion have been often imitated but never repeated. An actor, motorcycle and automobile racer, and all-around gearhead, McQueen also epitomized the American dream, rising from hardscrabble circumstances to become one of the most famous movie stars in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steve McQueen: Full-Throttle Cool presents McQueen&amp;rsquo;s life story in an artistic, graphic-novel format. It covers his entire life, from his earliest years growing up in a suburb of Indianapolis to his death from mesothelioma. Learn all about his stunning movie career, in which he defined the antihero archetype. The cool panache he brought to the screen was perhaps only matched by his adrenaline-pumping racing exploits. Get the full measure of both from this book.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The Red Baron&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In The Red Baron, graphic artist and author Wayne Vansant illustrates the incredible story of Manfred von Richthofen, whose unparalleled piloting prowess as a member of the Imperial German Army Air Service made him a World War I celebrity both in the air and on the ground. Vansant beautifully depicts the fearsome intelligence and mid-flight awareness that would earn Richthofen 80 air combat victories-from his rough beginnings, to the years he spent commanding Jasta 11 from the cockpit of his fabled red plane, to his eventual leadership of the infamous &amp;ldquo;Flying Circus,&amp;rdquo; named for the group&amp;rsquo;s colorful aircraft and mobile airfields. World War I&amp;rsquo;s most notorious flying ace died young under controversial circumstances, but the Red Baron&amp;rsquo;s legend and tactical acumen lived on far long after his death and helped usher in a new type of warfare that would reign supreme twenty-five years later: war in the air.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
