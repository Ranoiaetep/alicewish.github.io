&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;and I Love You&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m in love with you. Like, the kind where I want you to make love to me.  10 years after losing his wife, Haru receives this confession from his step-son Ryo. The two may not be related by blood but have up to this point lived a peaceful life as a family. Haru doesn&amp;rsquo;t want for their relationship to change.  He just wants things to stay as they are so nothing is broken. But love doesn&amp;rsquo;t always work like that.   &amp;ldquo;Playing Family,&amp;rdquo; the carefully written story of a step-dad battling his emotions for his step-son, and other sentimental love stories are contained in this bittersweet volume.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
