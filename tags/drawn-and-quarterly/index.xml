&lt;p&gt;Rolling Blackouts: Dispatches from Turkey, Syria, and Iraq (2016)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cartoonist Sarah Glidden accompanies her two friends—reporters and founders of a journalism non-profit—as they research potential stories on the effects of the Iraq War on the Middle East and, specifically, the war’s refugees. Joining the trio is a childhood friend and former Marine whose past service in Iraq adds an unexpected and sometimes unwelcome viewpoint, both to the people they come across and perhaps even themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the crew works their way through Turkey, Iraq, and Syria, Glidden observes the reporters as they ask civilians, refugees, and officials, “Who are you?” Everyone has a story to tell: the Iranian blogger, the United Nations refugee administrator, a taxi driver, the Iraqi refugee deported from the US, the Iraqis seeking refuge in Syria, and even the American Marine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glidden (How to Understand Israel in 60 Days or Less) records all that she encounters with a sympathetic and searching eye. Painted in her trademark soft, muted watercolors and written with a self-effacing humor, Rolling Blackouts cements Glidden’s place as one of today’s most original nonfiction voices.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;A User&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Neglectful Parenting&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With A User&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Neglectful Parenting, the trademark dry humor that pervades Guy Delisle&amp;rsquo;s landmark and praised graphic travelogues takes center stage. Quick, light vignettes play on the worries and cares any young parent might have, and offer wry solutions to the petty frustrations of being a dad who works from home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Readers familiar with Delisle&amp;rsquo;s stranger-in-a-strange-land technique for storytelling (employed in Jerusalem, Pyongyang, Burma, and Shenzhen) will recognize the titular parent in this book; Delisle&amp;rsquo;s travelogues were simultaneously portraits of complex places and times, and portraits of a stay-at-home dad&amp;rsquo;s ever-changing relationship with his children while his wife is out working for Doctors Without Borders. The relationship between young child and all-too-irony-aware parent is beautifully done here, and Delisle&amp;rsquo;s loose flowing style has been set free, creating a wonderful sense of motion throughout. A User&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Neglectful Parenting is an intimate, offbeat look at the joys of parenting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Ed the Happy Clown&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the late 1980s, the idiosyncratic Chester Brown (author of the muchlauded Paying for It and Louis Riel) began writing the cult classic comic book series Yummy Fur. Within its pages, he serialized the groundbreaking Ed the Happy Clown, revealing a macabre universe of parallel dimensions. Thanks to its wholly original yet disturbing story lines, Ed set the stage for Brown to become a world-renowned cartoonist. Ed the Happy Clown is a hallucinatory tale that functions simultaneously as a dark roller-coaster ride of criminal activity and a scathing condemnation of religious and political charlatanism. As the world around him devolves into madness, the eponymous Ed escapes variously from a jealous boyfriend, sewer monsters, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and a janitor with a Jesus complex. Brown leaves us wondering, with every twist of the plot, just how Ed will get out of this scrape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intimate, tangled world of Ed the Happy Clown is definitively presented here, repackaged with a new foreword by the author and an extensive notes section, and is, like every Brown book, astonishingly perceptive about the zeitgeist of its time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The Freddie Stories&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Freddie Stories traces a year in the life of Freddie, the youngest member of the dysfunctional Mullen family. These four-panel entries—each representing an episode in the life of Freddie—bring to life adolescence, pimples and all. With consummate skill, Lynda Barry writes about the cruelty of children at this most vulnerable age when the friends they make and the paths they choose can forever change their lives. Every word of dialogue, every piece of narration, and every dark line evokes adolescent angst. The Freddie Stories is an adult tale about just how hard it is to be a teenager, and it’s classic Barry work—poignant, insightful, and true.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Jamilti and Other Stories&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exit Wounds—a tale at once mystery and romance—introduced North American readers to the colorful and tightly woven narrative by Rutu Modan and was included in Time and Entertainment Weekly&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;best of&amp;rdquo; lists. Jamilti and Other Stories collects the cartoonist&amp;rsquo;s short works that lead the reader through unexpected turns of plot and unusual character portraits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some are darkly fantastical and unsettling, such as the unraveling of a serial-killer murder mystery, or her accounts of an infatuated plastic surgeon and his sanitarium, and a mother back from the dead with dubious healing powers. Others are more attuned to surprising discoveries that shape personal identity, as in the story of a tragic past that lies within a family&amp;rsquo;s theme hotel, or that of a struggling musician who hopes an upcoming gig will be his big break. In &amp;ldquo;Jamilti,&amp;rdquo; Modan addresses political violence with a suicide bombing that shakes up a day in the lives of a young couple.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Playboy</title>

&lt;p&gt;The Playboy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with every Chester Brown book, The Playboy-originally published in 1992-was ahead of its time, illustrating the fearlessness and prescience of the iconoclastic cartoonist. A memoir about Brown&amp;rsquo;s adolescent sexuality and shame, The Playboy chronicles his teenage obsession with the magazine of the same name, but it&amp;rsquo;s also a work that explores the physical form of comics to their fullest storytelling capacity. In it, a fifteen-year-old Chester is visited by a time-traveling adult Chester, and the latter narrates the former&amp;rsquo;s compulsion to purchase each issue of Playboy as it appears on newsstands. Even more fascinating than his obsession with the magazine is his need to keep his habit secret and the resulting lengths to which he goes to avoid detection by his family and, later, his girlfriends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The comics that became The Playboy first appeared in issues of Brown&amp;rsquo;s controversial, groundbreaking comic Yummy Fur more than twenty years ago, and yet the frankness of the work makes it seem avant-garde even now. As in every work by this master cartoonist, The Playboy uses no extra words, no extra panels, no extra lines, conveying environment and emotion through perfectly chosen moments. Fans of his acclaimed and controversial memoir Paying for It are sure to be drawn in by this early autobiographical portrait of blazing honesty. The expanded reissue includes all-new appendixes and notes from the author.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;One! Hundred! Demons!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lynda Barry&amp;rsquo;s beloved, genre-defying work of “autobifictionalography” One! Hundred! Demons! exploded the comic book medium, ending up on “Best Of” lists from Time Magazine and the Chicago Tribune. In these seventeen vignettes that touch on the scent of people&amp;rsquo;s homes, why babies are the best dancers, and how pretentious exboyfriends are like head lice, Barry brings her demons out to be exorcised. Described as “brutally honest, thoughtful and soulful” by Nick Hornby in the New York Times, One! Hundred! Demons! takes on Barry&amp;rsquo;s childhood with humor and poignancy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t Go Where I Can&amp;rsquo;t Follow&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this collection of letters, drawings, and photos, Anders Nilsen chronicles a six-year relationship and the illness that brought it to an end. Don’t Go Where I Can’t Follow is an eloquent appreciation of the time the author shared with his fiancée, Cheryl Weaver. The story is told using artifacts of the couple’s life together, including early love notes, simple and poetic postcards, tales of their travels in written and comics form, journal entries, and drawings done in the hospital in her final days. It concludes with a beautifully rendered account of Weaver’s memorial that Glen David Gold, writing in the Los Angeles Times, called “16 panels of beauty and grace.” Don’t Go Where I Can’t Follow is a deeply personal romance, and a universal reminder of our mortality and the significance of the relationships we build. Originally published as a limited edition in 2006, this collection includes a new afterword written by Nilsen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
