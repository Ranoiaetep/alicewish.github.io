&lt;p&gt;What I Did&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a collection of three of the acclaimed cartoonist&amp;rsquo;s earliest graphic novels, which are about Scandinavian mysteries, childhood stunts gone wrong, and much more. Three classic Jason volumes in one omnibus!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Reading the Funnies&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From its high culture influence on Pop Art to its low culture appeal to children of all ages, the comic strip has had a lasting hold on the imaginations of generations. Noted writer Donald Phelps provides essays on popular classics, such as Chester Gould&amp;rsquo;s Dick Tracy, E.C. Segar&amp;rsquo;s Thimble Theatre (which produced Popeye), and Frank King&amp;rsquo;s Gasoline Alley. His keen eye discerns the sublime qualities of this most American art form with wit and refreshing candor. Reading the Funnies offers an elegant and eloquent look into this fascinating slice of American popular culture.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Flayed Corpse and Other Stories&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a blackly comedic take on horror tropes―a backpacker arrives in a strange town, a man and his dog delve into some mysterious woods―in the form of atmospheric short comics. Flayed Corpse and Other Stories contains more than two dozen of examples of Simmons’s deft voice and vision. The individual stories in Flayed Corpse stand on their own as minimasterpieces of skin-crawling terror, but collectively complement each other in a way that only heightens the anxiety and dread pouring from page to page. Flayed Corpse also collects several collaborations between Simmons and other cartoonists, including James Romberger, Anders Nilsen, Tara Booth, Eroyn Franklin, Tom Van Deusen, and Eric Reynolds, amongst others.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Dal Tokyo&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gary Panter began imagining Dal Tokyo, a future Mars that is terraformed by Texan and Japanese workers, as far back as 1972, appropriating a friend’s idea about “cultural and temporal collision” (The “Dal” is short for Dallas).Why Texan and Japanese? Panter says, “Because they are trapped in Texas, Texans are self-mythologizing. Because I was trapped in Texas at the time, I needed to believe that the broken tractor out back was a car of the future. Japanese, I’ll say, because of the exotic far-awayness of Japan from Texas, and because of the Japanese monster movies and woodblock prints that reached out to me in Texas. Japanese monster movies are part of the fabric of Texas.”In 1983, Panter finally got a chance to fully explore this world, and share it with an audience, when the L.A. Reader published the first 63 strips. A few years later, the Japanese reggae magazine Riddim picked up the strip, and Panter continued the saga of Dal Tokyo in monthly installments for over a decade.But none of these conceptual descriptions will prepare the reader for the confounding visual and verbal richness of Dal Tokyo, as Panter’s famous “ratty line” collides and colludes with near-Joycean wordplay, veering from more or less intelligible jokes to dizzying non-sequiturs to surreal eruptions that can engulf the entire panel in scribbles. One doesn&amp;rsquo;t read Dal Tokyo; one is absorbed into it and spit out the other side.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Amadeo &amp;amp; Maladeo: A Musical Duet&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawn in Blechman&amp;rsquo;s expressive, patented &amp;ldquo;wavy line&amp;rdquo; pen-and-ink style, Amadeo &amp;amp; Maladeo is the tale of two Mozart-esque half brothers. The aristocratic Amadeo begins his musical career playing violin for the King and Queen of Austria, while penurious, illegitimate Maladeo plays violin for pocket change on a street corner. Both face the trials and tribulations of fame as their stories intertwine and come full circle. Amadeo and Maladeo serves as an elegant and unvarnished metaphor for the hardships contemporary artists face, which appears to be a universal condition of civilization.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This graphic novel omnibus includes You Can’t Get There From Here, about a monster love triangle; Tell Me Something, about love, recovered; Meow Baby!, short genre comics; and The Living and the Dead, a hilariously deadpan (and gory) take on the traditional Romero-style zombie thriller. All of these yarns star Jason’s patented cast of tight-lipped (or -beaked) bird-, dog-, cat- and wolf-people, and showcase his compassion and wry wit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;5,000 Kilometers Per Second&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winner of the prestigious Grand Prize of the 2010 Angouleme Comics Festival, 5,000 Kilometers Per Second tells―or almost tells―the love story between Piero and Lucia, which begins with a casual glance exchanged by teenagers across the street through a window and ends with a last, desperate hook-up between two older, sadder one-time lovers. Executed in stunning watercolors and broken down into five chapters (set in Italy, Norway, Egypt, and Italy again), 5,000 Kilometers Per Second manages to refer to Piero and Lucia’s actual love story only obliquely, focusing instead on its first stirrings and then episodes in their life during which they are separated―a narrative twist that makes it even more poignant and heart-wrenching. 5,000 Kilometers Per Second is another delicate graphic-novel masterpiece from Europe.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Why Art?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is “Art”? It’s widely accepted that art serves an important function in society. But the concept falls under such an absurdly large umbrella and can manifest in so many different ways. Art can be self indulgent, goofy, serious, altruistic, evil, or expressive, or any number of other things. But how can it truly make lasting, positive change? In Why Art?, acclaimed graphic novelist Eleanor Davis (How To Be Happy) unpacks some of these concepts in ways both critical and positive, in an attempt to illuminate the highest possible potential an artwork might hope to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Land of the Sons&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a dystopic coming-of-age graphic novel about two brothers trying to discover the secret of their father’s diary. Two pre-adolescent brothers scavenge a post-apocalyptic landscape for anything that might help each other and their father exist for one more day. Although their survival hangs in the balance, the boys are obsessed with only one thing―the diary their father keeps. They’ve never been taught to read or write, but they have a hunch that the scribbles might answer their questions. Land of the Sons is Gipi’s most artistically accomplished work to date.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Die Laughing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a collection of darkly comic standalone strips by a cartoonist Herge (Tintin) idolized. Die Laughing, which is executed in stark black and white, takes aim at everyone and everything in its scathing critique of modern life, but is particularly ruthless toward animal abusers, the military industrial complex, and death penalty enthusiasts. Franquin’s loose but meticulous line work features expressionistic shadows and silhouettes that infuse his depressed, repressed, and oppressed characters with a disturbing manic energy. Die Laughing is filled with visual gags and gag-inducing visuals that will haunt you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Master caricaturist/portraitist Drew Friedman’s spectacular visual tribute to―well, old Jewish comedians―returns with a third and concluding installment that throws its net a bit wider to include a few women (Olive Oyl voice Mae Questel, Ed Sullivan show regular Jean Carroll, and The Rise of the Goldbergs creator Gertrude Goldberg); a handful of more contemporary figures (Richard Belzer, whoseLaw &amp;amp; Order: SVU gig has eclipsed his stand-up comedy, and Welcome Back, Kotter’s Gabe Kaplan); and pop-culture legends (Prof. Irwin Corey, legendary Warner Bros. voice artist Mel Blanc), plus among others Marty Ingels, Fyvush Finkel, Gary Morton, Sam Levenson, Bobby Remsen, Max Patkin, Marvin Kaplan, Norm Crosby, Sammy Shore, Joey Adams, Lou Jacobi, and Sid James. It’s a heaping pastrami sandwich of gloriously liver-spotted, wrinkled personalities, that will appeal to anyone who likes old people, Jews, or comedians.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;To Have and To Hold&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set in October 1962, while the world holds its collective breath awaiting the possibly apocalyptic climax of the unfolding Cuban Missile Crisis, the banality of everyday life goes on―and Lonnie and Kate Ross confront their own domestic cold war. As Kate, frustrated and disillusioned, looks outside her marriage for satisfaction, Lonnie&amp;rsquo;s justifiable suspicions of his wife&amp;rsquo;s infidelity lead him down a deadly rod of increasing paranoia and violence as he seeks to reclaim what he&amp;rsquo;s lost. Masterfully paced and drawn in Chaffee&amp;rsquo;s fluid, inky brushstrokes, To Have and To Hold captures the pulpy, nocturnal atmosphere of classic noir.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Things Just Get Away From You&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blessed with a lovely bouncy, rubbery SpongeBob SquarePants-y style, cartoonist and animator Walt Holcombe tells wildly imaginative stories of love gained and (often) lost. Things Just Get Away From You collects all of Holcombe&amp;rsquo;s late-1990s comics work, with a bonus new story, &amp;ldquo;Hails at Sea,&amp;rdquo; thrown in for good measure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The Strange Case of Edward Gorey&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing from a multitude of reference and his own personal relationship to Gorey, literary heavyweight Alexander Theroux has accomplished an amazing feat of illuminating the real Edward Gorey with ambiguity, wit, fervor and reverence, combined with honest and clear-eyed appraisals of his work. No Gorey fan can be without it. Black-and-white illustrations and photographs throughout.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The Search for Smilin&amp;rsquo; Ed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launched on his latest investigation by a remark from his brother about a shared childhood favorite (&amp;ldquo;Y&amp;rsquo;know, I heard that when Smilin&amp;rsquo; Ed died&amp;hellip; his body was never found!&amp;rdquo;), Deitch begins to uncover some truly amazing things about the kiddie-show host and his malevolent sidekick, Froggy the Gremlin. Meanwhile, Deitch&amp;rsquo;s muse and nemesis Waldo the Cat abandons Deitch to hang out with some demon buddies, and soon both Waldo and Deitch are closing in on the mysteries of Smilin&amp;rsquo; Ed and Froggy. Ranging across the entire twentieth century, replete with flashbacks, stories within stories, and guest appearances from other Deitch regulars, The Search for Smilin&amp;rsquo; Ed! is a narrative whirligig that shows Deitch at his wildest and woolliest. For those whose heads have started to spin at the complexity of &amp;ldquo;Deitch world,&amp;rdquo; Deitch scholar Bill Kartalopoulos offers a lengthy essay on the ins and outs of this ever-evolving, ever-expanding world where fantasy, reality, and satire combine, clash, and are sometimes downright indistinguishable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;From the editor of the acclaimed comics anthology NON comes this beautiful, emotive &amp;ldquo;Picto-Novella.&amp;rdquo; Largely wordless and cunningly rendered, this little book is sure to touch most folks. In The Last Lonely Saturday, an older man sits at his kitchen table, filled with melancholy. Dishes are piled up in the sink, a full pot of coffee burns on the counter; it&amp;rsquo;s a quiet scene of existential despair. It quickly becomes clear that the man is a widower, and today is the day to visit his departed wife&amp;rsquo;s gravesite. Little does he know that what the day holds for him will result in this being his last lonely Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The Interview&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This graphic novel is set in Italy in 2048. Raniero is a fifty-something psychologist whose marriage is failing. In the sky, strange bright triangles appear, bearing mysterious messages from an extraterrestrial civilization. Dora, his young patient, is part of the &amp;ldquo;New&amp;rdquo; Convention, a movement of young people preaching free love and alternative models to coupling and family. She declares that her telepathic abilities can parse the signal ― a warning of some kind. Initially skeptical, Raniero&amp;rsquo;s curiosity and attraction grows. The Interview is a science fiction novel that eschews the stars in favor of the delicate, fragile, interior world of human emotion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The Furry Trap&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Furry Trap contains 11 short stories, varying in length from one to 30 pages, as well as a number of “extras” that will flesh out the reader’s experience. From the title creatures in “Night of the Jibblers,” to the witches and ogres of “Cockbone,” to the Godzilla-sized, centaur-bodied depiction of the title character in “Jesus Christ,” to the disarmingly cute yet terrifying demons of “Demonwood,” to the depraved, caped crusading antihero in “Mark of the Bat,” Simmons is a master of creating terrifying beasties that inspire and inflict nightmarish horrors, usually taken to unforgettable extremes. The individual stories in The Furry Trap stand on their own as mini-masterpieces of skin-crawling terror, but collectively complement each other in a way that only heightens the anxiety and dread pouring from page to page. Just remember: You&amp;rsquo;ve been warned.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The Clouds Above is a rip-roaring adventure about a kid named Simon, who skips school one day with his cat, Jack. They climb a magic staircase leading skyward, encounter a sad cloud named Perch and get mixed up in a conflict involving him, some nasty storm clouds and an irritable flock of birds. Will they make back home safely in time for school tomorrow? This brilliant, full-color graphic novel doubles as a wondrous children&amp;rsquo;s book, recalling such classics as Where the Wild Things Are, The Wizard of Oz and The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, with its depiction of a fantastic world that lurks just around the corner from reality and that only children know exists.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Terr&amp;rsquo;ble Thompson&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1955, Gene Deitch embarked on a daily comic strip for United Features Syndicate that he hoped would become his life&amp;rsquo;s work. One of the most unusual strips of the decade, Terr&amp;rsquo;ble Thompson was about a very odd little boy who had his &amp;ldquo;Werld Hedd Quarters&amp;rdquo; in a tree house and was regarded far and wide as &amp;ldquo;the bravest, fiercest, most-best hero of all-time.&amp;rdquo; Terr&amp;rsquo;ble Thompson collects the entirety of Deitch&amp;rsquo;s short-lived inspiration for Tom Terrific, and a new generation will discover what could have been one of the great comic strips of all-time had it continued. The strip is drawn in a simple, modernist style that served as an antidote to the ubiquitous Disney look that had spread into all facets of popular culture. Terr&amp;rsquo;ble Thompson was a visual and verbal feast of fun that blended time and space, with Terr&amp;rsquo;ble going on adventures with great historic figures like Columbus, George Washington, and Davy Crockett.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

McElwee (a.k.a. &amp;ldquo;R.D. Bone&amp;rdquo;). Peopled with a cast out of a blaxploitation movie ― convicts, hustlers, drug addicts, crack whores, car thieves, and murderers ― these cult-classic comics straddle the line between satirizing and showing the harsh realities of urban life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Misery Loves Comedy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A psychiatric case study masquerading a fancy-pants graphic novel, Misery Loves Comedy collects Ivan Brunetti&amp;rsquo;s early issues (no pun intended) wait, let&amp;rsquo;s rephrase that. Misery Loves Comedy collects the first three issues of the legendary comic book series Schizo in their entirety, as well as a host of miscellaneous flotsam and jetsam from various anthologies, c. 1992-2005. Readers will find the author&amp;rsquo;s unwitting self-caricature as a paranoid, deluded young man intriguingly repugnant and often chuckle-inducing. Besides Brunetti&amp;rsquo;s trademark nihilism, self-loathing, relentless depression, and inchoate, spittle-soaked misanthropy, these earlier comics offer a dollop of scatology and blasphemy for that extra puerile, lowbrow tang. These are comics for those who enjoy witnessing one man&amp;rsquo;s sanity in its final death rattle, swinging its tail from anhedonia to schadenfreude and back again. Also: lots and lots of filthy jokes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I Am Not Okay With This&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sydney seems like a normal 15-year-old freshman. She hangs out underneath the bleachers, listens to music in her friend’s car, and gets into arguments with her annoying little brother ― but she also has a few secrets she’s only shared in her diary. Like how she’s in love with her best friend Dina, the bizarreness of her father&amp;rsquo;s death, and those painful telekinetic powers that keep popping up at the most inopportune times. In this collection of the self-published minicomic series, Forsman expertly channels the teenage ethos in a style that evokes classic comic strips while telling a powerful story about the intense, and sometimes violent, tug of war between trauma and control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Henry Speaks for Himself&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is it about odd-looking comic strip characters that catch the public’s attention? Carl Anderson’s classic comic strip character Henry was certainly not your average-looking youngster, with knobby knees, a pencil neck, and a bulbous, bald head but, for years, he entertained millions of readers worldwide with his pantomime pranks. He was also the subject of a long-running comic book series, with one significant difference from the newspaper strip – in the comic books, Henry spoke! Written and drawn by John Liney, who also handled art chores on the daily Henry strip, these stories were done in a Tintin-esque clean-line art style that made them attractive to the younger set, but with writing clever enough to cause the adults to chuckle while reading to their children. These 1940s-’50s stories have never before been reprinted, and this collection provides a long-overdue look at a forgotten “kid’s comic” masterpiece.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Fred the Clown&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Existential clown comedy as you like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEE! Fred the Clown get slapped regularly in his single-minded pursuit of l&amp;rsquo;amour!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HEAR! The screams of his lady friends from several blocks away!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SMELL! Fred the Clown&amp;rsquo;s scientifically improbable collection of fungal infections!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The signature creation of cartoonist Roger Langridge, Fred the Clown is the thinking man&amp;rsquo;s idiot. Fred has an eye for the ladies, as well as several other organs, but the only part of themselves they&amp;rsquo;re willing to share with him is a carefully placed kneecap&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fred the Clown&amp;rsquo;s misadventures are a curious balance of bleakness and joyful absurdism; the universe may dump on Fred from a great height, but he never gives up. More often than not, they involve the pursuit of a lady—any lady will do, it seems, but bearded ladies are at the top of the list. Disappointment seems inevitable, and it usually is; yet, almost despite himself, Langridge will occasionally give Fred a happy ending out of nowhere&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Langridge&amp;rsquo;s comics betray a restless stylistic playfulness, a pessimism about human nature, and an absurdist perspective on human folly that can be traced back through Monty Python, The Goon Show and even as far back as Lewis Carroll. Fred the Clown&amp;rsquo;s visual look often harks back to earlier eras, evoking the styles of (among others) Max Fleischer cartoons, classic newspaper strips, 19th-century illustration, the children&amp;rsquo;s books of Maurice Sendak and Doctor Seuss, and more. The sensibility, though, is thoroughly modern—no classic style goes unsubverted, no narrative is left without ending in emotional ambiguity or a pomposity-puncturing ironic gag. Underlying it all is Langridge&amp;rsquo;s own meticulous brush style. According to another New Zealand cartoonist, Hicksville creator Dylan Horrocks, &amp;ldquo;If Samuel Beckett had teamed up with the Goons and learned to draw like Tex Avery, the result would have been something very like the comics of Roger Langridge.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Art d&amp;rsquo;Ecco&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the late 1980s, long before his work on the Eisner and Harvey-nominated Fred the Clown, Roger Langridge worked with his brother Andrew on a comic called Art d&amp;rsquo;Ecco. In these early stories, done mainly (but seldom entirely) for laughs, one can see the beginnings of the formal playfulness that would characterize the later work of both Langridge brothers, and of the elaborate layering of subtle and not-so-subtle nods and references to the world of music, film and literature.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney&amp;rsquo;s Mickey Mouse&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s America knows Mickey Mouse as a gentle do-gooder. But in his heyday, Mickey rose to fame as an epic hero—a bold, adventurous scrapper battling mobsters, kidnappers, and spies! Mickey&amp;rsquo;s greatest feats of daring took place in his daily comic strip, crafted by one of history greatest cartoonists, Floyd Gottfredson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For 25 years, Gottfredson&amp;rsquo;s Mickey Mouse strip was a trendsetting serial that led where other adventure comics would follow. But as great and influential as Gottfredson&amp;rsquo;s life&amp;rsquo;s work is, it has never been comprehensively collected in English&amp;hellip; until now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unreal City&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unreal City contains five highly charged stories about relationships: &amp;ldquo;Echoes into Eternity,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Evelyn Dalton-Hoyt,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Emordana,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;The Yellowknife Retrospective,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Objet d&amp;rsquo;Art.&amp;rdquo; The stories address gender, narcissism, marriage, subjectivity, objectification, and the thin line that divides love from hate. Bryant&amp;rsquo;s characters sometimes feel like they are navigating their way through the darkness in an attempt to make sense of love, sex, art, and life. Existential and elliptical, the stories play beautifully against Bryant&amp;rsquo;s precise and fully-realized artwork, which echoes such masters as Jaime Hernandez and Daniel Clowes. In Unreal City, characters cannot walk into a room without their world turning inside out. Readers will be similarly upended by the discovery of this major new talent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Love &amp;amp; Rockets Library&lt;/p&gt;

In Fritz after Dark, which collects the graphic novels Luba: Three Daughters, High Soft Lisp, and more, the children are growing up and lovers have come and gone (and come and gone again) as Luba, Petra, and Fritz move on to the next phases of their lives and careers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The Complete Crepax&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spanning the 1960s–1980s, this science-fiction-themed second volume of our complete Guido Crepax library features, in addition to adventuress Valentina, two more of the famed Italian erotic artist’s heroines. Marianna is a mysterious friend of Valentina’s (or is she? And why do they look so alike?). Belinda is a motorcycle-driving, pop art action star inspired by then-contemporary characters like Barbarella. In The Time Eater, Valentina meets a curious couple in an asylum, encounters strange creatures on a photo assignment, is caught in a Rube-Goldberg-like death trap, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take That, Adolf!: The Fighting Comic Books of the Second World War&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between 1941 and 1945, Hitler was pummeled on comic book covers by everyone from Captain America to Wonder Woman. Take That, Adolf! is an oversized compilation of more than 500 stunningly restored comics covers published during World War II, featuring America&amp;rsquo;s greatest super-villain. From Superman and Daredevil to propaganda and racism, Take That, Adolf! is a fascinating look at how legendary creators such as Joe Simon, Jack Kirby, Alex Schomburg, Will Eisner, and Lou Fine entertained millions of kids on the home front and buoyed the spirits of GIs fighting overseas by using Adolf Hitler as a punching bag.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Collects a dozen comic short stories by the acclaimed cartoonist behind Fante Bukowski and The Hypo. Noah Van Sciver is a keen observer of the human condition, exploring the decisions people make that make, break, and define them. Disquiet showcases the best of his short comics work, including: &amp;ldquo;The Death Of Elijah Lovejoy,&amp;rdquo; the story of the midwestern abolitionist in the 1830s;&amp;ldquo;The Lizard Who Laughed,&amp;rdquo; a painfully dysfunctional reunion; and &amp;ldquo;Punks V.

&lt;p&gt;Betsy and Me&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having mastered comic books and gag cartoons, in 1958 Jack Cole set his sights on the cartoonist&amp;rsquo;s pot of gold—a syndicated newspaper strip. He hit the bull&amp;rsquo;s-eye with Betsy and Me, a breezy domestic farce focusing on a middle-class urban couple and their smart-aleck genius son. Betsy and Me was an instant success and newpapers were lining up to buy it. Then, with only two-and-a-half month&amp;rsquo;s worth of strips completed, Cole purchased a .22 caliber pistol and ended his life. For Betsy and Me, featuring city dweller Chet Tibbit&amp;rsquo;s day-to-day stuggles and achievements, Cole stripped his style down to its bare essentials, creating a strip that sparkles with economy, wit, and charm. What gave the strip its edge, however, was Cole&amp;rsquo;s innovative storytelling. As R.C. Harvey writes in his introduction, &amp;ldquo;Cole&amp;rsquo;s storytelling manner was unique: the comedy arose from the pictures&amp;rsquo; contradicting the narrative prose. Cole&amp;rsquo;s fatuous protagonist and narrator would say one thing in the captions accompanying the drawings, but the pictures of his actions showed the opposite, revealing [him] to be a trifle pretentious and wholly delusional.&amp;rdquo; Harvey&amp;rsquo;s intro also serves as a biographical sketch and sheds light on the circumstances surrounding Cole&amp;rsquo;s suicide.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Total Jazz&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blutch riffs on two quintessentially American art forms — jazz and comics. In this freewheeling collection of short stories and vignettes, the famed French cartoonist examines not only the music, but the nature of the jazz sub-culture. The grumpy festival goer, the curmudgeonly collector, and many other fan “types” are the targets of his unerring gimlet eye. Drawn in a range of styles as improvisational as Coltrane and Mingus ― everything from loose linework to tight pen and ink to gestural pencils ― Blutch captures the excitement of live performance, the lovelorn, and the Great Jazz Detective, who is out but not down.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;House&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This adventurous, silent graphic novel demonstrates the solid strength of this young cartoonist&amp;rsquo;s storytelling ability. Whether plunging into the watery depths of a sinkhole that has obviously swallowed part of a town or entering the uncertain hidden corridors of the house, every turn is captured with intensity by Simmons&amp;rsquo; scratchy pen. Page composition and panel arrangements are masterfully coordinated to reflect the characters&amp;rsquo; increasingly claustrophobic panic as the story reaches its crescendo, and to cause a similar and palpable reaction in the reader. House is Josh Simmons&amp;rsquo; first full-length graphic novel after years of honing his craft on the humorous, underground comic series Happy, and it is a visual and formal tour de force that proclaims Simmons a major cartooning talent of the new century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wally Gropius&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Superficially resembling 1960s teenage humor comics, Tim Hensley&amp;rsquo;s graphic novel Wally Gropius is actually an acute satire of power, celebrityhood, and modern culture that tells the story of the titular character, who bears a closer resemblance to a teenaged Richie Rich or a classmate of Archie Andrews at Riverdale High than he does the famous Bauhaus architect whose name he shares. Wally is the human Dow Jones, the heir to a vast petrochemical conglomerate. When the elder Thaddeus Gropius confronts Wally with the boilerplate plot ultimatum that he must marry &amp;lsquo;the saddest girl in the world&amp;rsquo; or be disinherited, a yarn unravels that is part screwball comedy and part unhinged parable on the lucrativeness of changing your identity. Hensley&amp;rsquo;s dialogue is witty, lyrical, sampled, dada, and elliptical&amp;ndash;all in the service of a very bizarre mystery. There&amp;rsquo;s sex, violence, rock and roll, intrigue, and betrayal&amp;ndash;all brought home in Hensley&amp;rsquo;s truly inimitable style. Created during an era when another well-off &amp;lsquo;W&amp;rsquo; was stuffing the coffers of the morbidly solvent, Wally Gropius transforms futile daydreams and nightmares into the absurdity of capital.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Nudnik Revealed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by a real-life incident―getting his tie caught in a moving Moviola editing machine―Gene Deitch, cartoonist, animator, memoirist, renaissance man, created Nudnik, his Everyman character, a cross between Candide and Godot. The star of 12 Paramount-produced animated shorts that ran in theatres as an opening to the main movie in 1964 and 1965, Nudnik was one of Deitch’s most creatively personal and commercially successful creations in a long career of innovative and successful work, including the award-winning animated versions of Jules Feiffer’s Munroand Maurice Sendak’s Where the Wild Things Are. Nudnik is the well-intentioned, kind, cheerful, but bumbling naif, inspired by and reflecting such archetypal characters as Jackie Gleason’s Poor Soul, Charlie Chaplin’s Tramp, and Charles Schulz’s Charlie Brown. He never gets a break, can’t do anything right, but somehow muddles through, dignity more or less intact. Nudnik Revealed! finally collects all of Deitch’s original drawings, sketches, model sheets, storyboards, and color “set-ups” that he drew during the Nudnik production season of ’64-’65, all reproduced from original art, showcasing his lively pencil line and his slick, authoritative pen and ink work. Deitch, a born storyteller and one of the great raconteurs of comics and animation, accompanies the copious examples of art with a running commentary―by turns, funny, spirited, and chock full of historical insights.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;From Shadow to Light: The Life and Art of Mort Meskin&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Shadow to Light: The Life and Art of Mort Meskin is a coffee table art book and critical biography of one of the twentieth century’s most influential comic book artists. Meskin’s career spanned both the Golden and Silver ages of comics, from the 1940s to the 1960s. His drawing, chiaroscuro technique, and storytelling are considered by connoisseurs of the form to be among the most sophisticated of his time. His passion for his artwork was equaled by his skill, and the quality of his overall oeuvre blurs the artificial distinction between high and low art. Yet he is known mostly among hard-core aficionados today, eclipsed by many of his peers, some of whom he profoundly influenced. Among Meskin’s fans and admirers are Jim Steranko, Joe Kubert, Alex Toth, Carmine Infantino, Steve Ditko, Jerry Robinson, and Jack Kirby. From Shadow to Light: The Life and Art of Mort Meskin will finally give this neglected artist the recognition he’s due.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Flannery O&amp;rsquo;Connor: The Cartoons&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flannery O’Connor was among the greatest American writers of the second half of the 20th century; she was a writer in the Southern tradition of Eudora Welty, William Faulkner, and Carson McCullers, who wrote such classic novels and short stories as Wise Blood, The Violent Bear It Away, and “A Good Man is Hard to Find.” She is perhaps as well known for her tantalizing brand of Southern Gothic humor as she is for her Catholicism. That these tendencies should be so happily married in her fiction is no longer a surprise. The real surprise is learning that this much beloved icon of American literature did not set out to be a fiction writer, but a cartoonist. This seems to be the last well-kept secret of her creative life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Boy&amp;rsquo;s Club&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cartoonist Matt Furie’s deadpan comics showcase slacker roommates Andy, Brett, Landwolf, and Pepe in a series of comical vignettes combining laconic psychedelia, childlike enchantment, drug-fueled hedonism, and impish mischief. The perpetually insouciant glaze of his characters belie the sharp verbal and visual wit of Furie, who delivers a stoner classic for the Tumblr generation. In fact, Furie’s wildly popular teenage weirdoes became an overnight internet sensation when Pepe the Frog was widely adopted by users of 4chan and remixed ad infinitum from there (including uses by pop stars like Nicki Minaj and Katy Perry), giving Boy’s Club built-in recognition with many. A spiritual cousin to Simon Hanselmann’s Megahex and Joán Cornella’s Mox Nox, Boy’s Club’s sense of humor will especially resonate with fans of stoner comedies and black humor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humbug&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know MAD. Do you know Humbug? Harvey Kurtzman changed the face of American humor when he created the legendary MAD comic. As editor and chief writer from its inception in 1952, through its transformation into a slick magazine, and until he left MAD in 1956, he influenced an entire generation of cartoonists, comedians, and filmmakers. In 1962, he co-created the long-running Little Annie Fanny with his long-time artistic partner Will Elder forPlayboy, which he continued to produce until his virtual retirement in 1988. Between MAD and Annie Fanny, Kurtzman&amp;rsquo;s biographical summaries will note that he created and edited three other magazines―Trump, Humbug, and Help!―but, whereas his MAD and Annie Fanny are readily available in reprint form, his major satirical work in the interim period is virtually unknown. Humbug, which had poor distribution, may be the least known, but to those who treasure the rare original copies, it equals or even exceeds MAD in displaying Kurtzman&amp;rsquo;s creative genius. Humbug was unique in that it was actually published by the artists who created it: Kurtzman and his cohorts from MAD, Will Elder, Jack Davis, and Al Jaffee, were joined by universally acclaimed cartoonist Arnold Roth. With no publisher above them to rein them in, this little band of creators produced some of the most trenchant and engaging satire of American culture ever to appear on American newsstands.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Cosplayers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Annie and Verti are two teen cosplayers with too much time on their hands. Annie wants to act, and Verti wants to be a photographer/filmmaker. Together, they embark on making a film starring themselves and featuring an unsuspecting cast of extras they record via hidden camera. What could possibly go wrong? A one-shot dose of humor and melancholy from the creator of New School, BodyWorld, and Bottomless Belly Button.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Artists Authors Thinkers Directors&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A self-portrait through one hundred portraits, Artists Authors Thinkers Directors explores cartoonist Paul Hornschemeier&amp;rsquo;s sketchbook renderings of those who shaped his (and many others&amp;rsquo;) artistic views. Culled from his drawing blog ― The Daily Forlorn, now one of Tumblr&amp;rsquo;s featured illustration blogs, adding thousands of new followers every week ― these portraits are as stylistically varied as the subjects they portray. A scrawled, single line drawing of Lenny Bruce shares space with a triangular Werner Heisenberg. A monochromatic, stippled Stanley Kubrick stares intently at a muppetheaded Frank Oz. Each turn of the page offers a new take on a familiar face. In the afterword, Hornschemeier includes brief notes on each portrait and that creator&amp;rsquo;s particular work or insight that spoke specifically to him. And in that specificity, much of what is universally affecting in each creator shines through. Hornschemeier&amp;rsquo;s graphic novels hop from one aesthetic to the next, varying the line and color quality to depict his narrative&amp;rsquo;s mood. He plays with the language of comics. In these portraits we can clearly see him hard at experimentation, adding to his vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Funeral of the Heart&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funeral of the Heart is Leah Hayes&amp;rsquo; stylistic tour-de-force and graphic novel debut, featuring a series of short stories by Hayes and illustrated entirely using the otherworldly medium of scratchboard. Hayes creates a world of unease and ambiguity populated by obsessive characters, forlorn animals, and mysterious, inanimate objects; odd occurrences, unnerving deaths and unconventional but genuine love bind these characters and their stories together. In &amp;ldquo;The Bathroom,&amp;rdquo; a middle-aged couple discover a mysterious tunnel in their poolhouse after a neighbor&amp;rsquo;s child accidentally drowns in their pool—leading to an immaculate bathroom and another drowning. In &amp;ldquo;The Needle,&amp;rdquo; two sisters suffer the death of their grandmother as well as her possible resurrection at the hands of the woman with the needle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;When the formulaic constraints, censorious nature, and onerous lack of creator&amp;rsquo;s rights in mainstream comics got to be too much for the brilliant cartoonist Wallace Wood, he struck out on his own with the self-published witzend. It became a haven for Wood and his fellow professional cartoonist friends where they could produce the kind of personal work that they wanted to do, without regard to commercial demands ― and with friends like Frank Frazetta, Al Williamson, Reed Crandall, Ralph Reese, Archie Goodwin, Angelo Torres, Steve Ditko, Harvey Kurtzman, Bill Elder, Art Spiegelman, Don Martin, Vaughn Bodé, Jim Steranko, Jeff Jones, Howard Chaykin, Trina Robbins, Bernie Wrightson, and literally dozens more, it was bound to be a great ride!

But is a lost dog ever really just a lost dog? Like, what if it&amp;rsquo;s not America&amp;rsquo;s Dog that&amp;rsquo;s lost, but America itself?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Finally, what the world has been waiting for - a big, oversized collection of Gerald Jabolonski&amp;rsquo;s psychedelically underground, absurdly avant-garde comics! Jablonski has been comics&amp;rsquo; best-kept secret for decades, telling the tales of imposter ants, bear-faced grumps, and stoic farmers with pun-laden word balloons that wildly snake around the page. This book also includes a discussion with Gary Groth, the artist&amp;rsquo;s first interview in print. Jablonski belongs in the ingeniously baffling auteur pantheon with John Cage, James Joyce, and Andy Warhol. Yes, you read that right.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Based on the author&amp;rsquo;s dreams, this German Expressionist-influenced graphic novel is about a couple who go to an underground site to visit his family, and surreal events ensue. Drawn in a slashing pen-and-ink style with raw crosshatching and heavy blacks, the author&amp;rsquo;s visual approach adds to the intense, claustrophobic feel of the graphic novel, while its surreal verisimilitude recalls cult films like Eraserhead and The Forbidden Zone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Something dark is growing in Mopu. The only question is whether the danger that will undo the women’s delicate camaraderie is outside the gates―or within. House of Women is Goldstein’s second solo graphic novel, following 2015’s The Oven (AdHouse Books), which appeared on many year-end “Best of ” lists, including Publisher’s Weekly and Slate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The Pin-Up Art of Humorama&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the 1950s, under the Humorama banner, Abe Goodman churned out scores of cheap digest-sized magazines that featured cheesecake photos and single panel pin-up cartoons.

In addition to these three pin-up cartooning luminaries, other notable who contributed to the pages of the Humorama digests included longtime illustrator Jefferson Machamer; Basil Wolverton, who influenced a generation of underground cartoonists; Mad&amp;rsquo;s Dave Berg (&amp;ldquo;The Lighter Side&amp;rdquo;); and future syndicated cartoonists George Crenshaw (&amp;ldquo;Belvedere&amp;rdquo;), Bill Hoest (&amp;ldquo;The Lockhorns&amp;rdquo;) and Brad Anderson (&amp;ldquo;Marmaduke&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Multimedia artist Charles Glaubitz delivers his first graphic novel, a work of mythical, pictorial, illustrative, and cosmological components, while combining elements of myth, religion, and spirituality with comics, hermetic ideas, alchemy and science. Light travels through space and brings a prophecy of the awakening of the Crystal Sigil. At the same time, the secret society of Illuminati steals from the four elements to create a new fifth element that has the power to become any object of desire. The ensuing epic battle pits the warrior-like Starseed Children ― who are the end result of the evolution of revolution within our system of genetics, philosophy, science, and art ― against the Illuminati and their masters, the Annunaki, and the coming of the black darkness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Sam Zabel and the Magic Pen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acclaimed cartoonist Dylan Horrocks returns with a long-awaited new graphic novel, the first since his perennial classic, 1998&amp;rsquo;s Hicksville. Cartoonist Sam Zabel hasn&amp;rsquo;t drawn a comic in years. Stuck in a nightmare of creative block and despair, Sam spends his days writing superhero stories for a large American comics publisher and staring at a blank piece of paper, unable to draw a single line. Then one day he finds a mysterious old comic book set on Mars and is suddenly thrown headlong into a wild, fantastic journey through centuries of comics, stories, and imaginary worlds. Accompanied by a young webcomic creator named Alice and an enigmatic schoolgirl with rocket boots and a bag full of comics, Sam goes in search of the Magic Pen, encountering sex-crazed aliens, medieval monks, pirates, pixies and - of course - cartoonists. Funny, erotic, and thoughtful, Sam Zabel and the Magic Pen explores the pleasures, dangers, and moral consequences of fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Saint Cole&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saint Cole depicts four days in the life of a twenty-eight-year-old suburbanite named Joe who feels trapped working overtime at a pizza restaurant to support his girlfriend, Nicole, and their infant child. Especially when Nicole invites her troubled mother, Angela, to move into their two-bedroom apartment until she lands on her feet again. Joe reacts to this development by further retreating into alcohol. He thinks he loves Nicole but resents her at the same time. They probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t still be with each other if she hadn&amp;rsquo;t become pregnant. Joe wants out. He&amp;rsquo;s angry. He&amp;rsquo;s in a position to act rashly. And he does. This sophomore graphic novel from Noah Van Sciver may seem like a left turn from his critically acclaimed debut graphic novel biography of Abraham Lincoln (The Hypo), yet upon closer reflection, it continues Van Sciver&amp;rsquo;s interest in pathos and the human condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Van Sciver[&amp;rsquo;s]&amp;hellip; spare style and determined cross-hatching allow a vivid sense of the scene - personal and social, ballroom to slave pen. He has successfully captured all these and brought them to life with his own idiosyncratic touch.&amp;rdquo; - Paul Buhle, Rain Taxi&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Not Funny Ha-Ha is a bold, slightly wry graphic novel illustrating the lives of two young women from different cultural, family, and financial backgrounds who go through two different abortions (medical and surgical). It does not address the events leading up to the pregnancy, or even the decision-making before choosing abortion as an option. It simply shows what happens when a woman goes through it, no questions asked. It follows them through the process of choosing a clinic, reaching out to friends, partners, and/or family&amp;hellip; and eventually the procedure(s) itself. Despite the fact that so many women and girls have abortions every day, in every city, all around us&amp;hellip; it can be a lonely experience. Not Funny Ha-Ha is a little bit technical, a little bit moving, and often funny, in a format uniquely suited to communicate. The book is meant to be a non-judgmental, comforting, even humorous look at what a woman can go through during an abortion. Although the subject matter is heavy, the illustrations are light. The author takes a step back from putting forth any personal opinion whatsoever, simply laying out the events and possible emotional repercussions that could, and often do, occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This graphic novel is the abortion story that needs to be heard.&amp;rdquo; - The Huffington Post&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;My Pretty Vampire&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clover ― the “pretty” vampire of the title ― is a Bardot-esque blonde who dreams of the (now-dead) girl she once was four years ago before becoming a fanged bloodsucker. She is being kept prisoner by her brother, Marcel, who fears Clover will be hunted by the outside world (and who may have other, more selfish motivations as well). Clover’s curiosity, however, will not be suppressed: impetuous, sensual, strong-willed, and fearless, she plans her escape. The resultant havoc would make Dario Argento proud. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Mascots&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Mascots, a collection of impressionistic stories combine to create a wildly absurd―yet vaguely familiar―parallel world. Like Fenwick&amp;rsquo;s previous work, the acclaimed Hall of Best Knowledge (one ofBooklist&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Top Ten Graphic Novels of 2008&amp;rdquo;), Mascots is driven by lettering and language, part art and part comics, this time taking the form of bright, full-color paintings on found book covers. These paintings can be experienced individually, each on their own terms, but together they reveal a surreal world that captures the mood of our times with manic energy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;John Stanley: Giving Life to Little Lulu&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a deluxe, full-color, coffee table book biography; the first of one of America&amp;rsquo;s greatest storytellers. It&amp;rsquo;s filled with beautifully reproduced artwork from the comic books Little Lulu, and his creations Melvin Monster and Thirteen(Going on Eighteen); rare drawings and cartoons; and never-before-seen photographs. Bill Schelly tells Stanley&amp;rsquo;s life story through interviews with his family, friends, and colleagues: his childhood in Harlem and the Bronx, life with his strict Irish Catholic mother, his education at Parsons, his first job as an animator at Max Fleischer Studios, and his years working as a commercial artist, before finding his true métier in comic books during World War II (while battling clinical depression and alcoholism).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Perfect Nonsense: The Chaotic Comics and Goofy Games of George Carlson&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perfect Nonsense tells the complete story behind one of the most innovative and under-rated Golden Age artists, classic children&amp;rsquo;s illustrators, and nonsense poets in American history. For more than 50 years, George Carlson created thousands of distinctive and dynamic cartoons, comics, riddles, and games that thrilled both children and adults with their fanciful spirit and nonsensical humor. There has never been a career retrospective of this startling cartoonist and illustrator ― until now! Carlson&amp;rsquo;s inspired cartoons ― ranging from the intellectual to the surreal ― place him at home with not only acknowledged masters of American humor like George Herriman, S. J. Perelman, Milt Gross, Bill Holman, and Jack Kent, but also globally celebrated absurdists like Beckett, Pirandello, and his life-long inspiration, Lewis Carroll.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Queen of the Black Black&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Megan Kelso was a classic DIY cartoonist/publisher, who crafted and self-published her popular minicomic Girlhero from 1991 to 1996. Queen of the Black Black, which collects these early Girlhero strips (as well as a few from other sources) and was originally published in a limited edition twelve years ago (now long out of print), provides an engrossing chronicle of an ambitious young cartoonist carefully developing her own unique style and approach. In this volume, Kelso scrutinizes bicycle messengers, venereal diseases, infidelity, unwanted pregnancies, temporary work assignments, family reunions, and classroom daydreams in subtle and unexpected manners, setting herself technical challenges such as depicting music in comics (the virtuoso &amp;ldquo;The Daddy Mask,&amp;rdquo; with its sensuous gray swirls of sound on the page), integrating lettering into artwork in creative ways, and generally working her way toward what would become her mature style. The title story, &amp;ldquo;Queen of the Black Black,&amp;rdquo; rendered in lush gray tones, explores the fraught relationship between the aging, demanding queen of a fairy-tale realm and a hornblower whom she takes under her wing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Nuts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember how baffling, terrifying, and sad childhood really was? Now you can laugh at it. In this thematically and narratively linked series of one-page stories originally published in the National Lampoon&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Funny Pages&amp;rdquo; section throughout the 1970s, the master of the macabre eschewed his usual ghouls, vampires, and end-of-the-world scenarios for a wry, pointed look at growing up normal in the real, yet endlessly weird world. This is essentially a lost Gahan Wilson graphic novel from the 1970s and &amp;lsquo;80s. Watch as our stoic, hunting-cap-wearing protagonist (known only as &amp;ldquo;The Kid&amp;rdquo;) copes with illness, disappointment, strange old relatives, the disappointment of Christmas, life-threatening escapades, death, school, the awfulness of camp, and much more ― all delineated in Wilson&amp;rsquo;s roly-poly, sensual, delicately hatched line.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

A deep space transport has been developed to take a small crew to an earth-like, habitable planet in a nearby system in an attempt to begin colonization/repopulation. The internet is now telepathic and referred to as the &amp;ldquo;innernet.&amp;rdquo; When the hub is revealed to be a human child, Melody McCabe is hired to develop the new nexus on the second International Space Station. Working within the structure of sci-fi, Nod Away moves back and forth between physical and psychological worlds, utilizing traditional and abstract storytelling styles to explore what consciousness could be, where it could possibly be located, and what function or point it might serve.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Peppy in the Wild West&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lost, all-ages, classic graphic novel ― by the creator of Tintin! Created by Hergé when he was drawing the first few Tintin comics, and first serialized in black and white in 1934, this is the first publication of his lighthearted adventure Peppy in the Wild West ― and the only English translation since 1969. When his hat business fails, the bear Peppy heads to the Old West to start a new life, accompanied by his sweet wife, Virginny, and his faithful steed, Bluebell. They find a patch of grass somewhere in California, where Peppy’s hats start a craze among the local Rabbit-Ears tribe. What follows is a rollicking cascade of one thing after another: not one, but two kidnappings, a river full of gold, a bulldog outlaw, and a side trip to Santa Barbara!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The Squirrel Mother&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kelso&amp;rsquo;s work is characterized by subject matter that fits roughly into two disparate camps: personal and semi-autobiographical stories that draw heavily on the details of her childhood and adolescence, and stories about the idea of America and American history, such as a trilogy of short pieces about Alexander Hamilton. Her work is distinguished from many of her contemporaries as much by her spare, elegant, calligraphic linework, leisurely pacing, and psychological acuity as it is by the absence of nihilism, scatology, pedantry, and formal experimentalism. Her work is charming, witty, nuanced, slightly elusive, and sharply observed. The Squirrel Mother features 15 stories of between three and twenty-two pages in full color, including two stories, &amp;ldquo;Meow Face&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Aide de Camp,&amp;rdquo; done especially for this volume. The personal stories are each self-contained but in a sense take place in the same world where similar characters inhabit different stories. The &amp;ldquo;America&amp;rdquo; stories are broader in subject matter, taking on events of political and historical significance and wrestling with ideas having to do with the American experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The Mythology of S. Clay Wilson&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Age of Aquarius morphed into Discomania and Reaganomics, pioneering underground cartoonist S. Clay Wilson discovered a new generation of punks and misfits in America and abroad who appreciated his point of view. He found new outlets for his artwork in outré galleries and fringe publications, and continued to contribute to the surviving remnants of the underground, including the never-say-die classic anthology, Zap Comix. He made two tours of Europe, collaborated with William Burroughs and Ken Kesey, appeared on MTV, and had several highly acclaimed exhibitions in Seattle, Los Angeles, and New York. The Checkered Demon became ascendant among his creations ― the prolific headliner of a series of comic titles that followed his adventures around the earth and across the galaxies. This is the second of a three-volume series reprinting his best comics and chronicling his life in a series of prose chapters. Demons and Angels features his two solo comics, 2 and 22, strips fromCocaine Comix, Knockabout, Weird Smut, and all his stories from Zap Comix #6–11. Strips in obscure mags like Jump Start, Mondo Montana, Deadbeat, Too Fun Too Huge, Boiled Owl, Maggot-Zine, andWeird Smut are also included, as well as many never published privately commissioned watercolors and paintings produced for his discriminating art collectors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Abandoned Cars&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This debut collection of short stories are united by their exploration of the great American mythological drama. Tim Lane&amp;rsquo;s characters exist on the margins of society&amp;ndash;alienated, floating in the void between hope and despair. Visually reminiscent of Al Feldstein and Charles Burns, Lane&amp;rsquo;s idiosyncratic and tense realism weaves between comic absurdity, nightmarish naturalism, chemical hallucination, and ecstatic terror. Lane&amp;rsquo;s America is a haunted Coney Island, made up of lost characters haplessly shooting themselves in the face, and hopping freight trains in search of Elvis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;A Mess of Everything&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Mess of Everything is the second volume in Miss Lasko-Gross&amp;rsquo;s semi-autobiographical trilogy, picking up where the first volume, left off: self-effacing non-conformist Melissa is now in high school, where the stakes are higher as she copes with an anxiety-induced drug habit and an anorexic best friend. Melissa finds herself negotiating the kinds of everyday problems facing young adults today - such as alienating her friends with her uncomfortable honesty and accidentally breaking her best guy friend&amp;rsquo;s heart. Eventually, her woes cause her to nearly flunk out of school, and by the end of the book Melissa faces the choice that we all do at some point: to take the risk and pursue her dreams or settle for a safer, more secure routine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unsentimental truthfulness that is the hallmark of Lasko-Gross&amp;rsquo;s work is coupled with a raw but increasingly refined visual vocabulary. A Mess of Everything is an intense, honest, and funny memoir that holds appeal for anyone who is navigating, or who has ever grappled with, these issues. She expresses the awkward naïveté and inexperience of a young girl with the keen insights of a mature artist.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Blecky Yuckerella&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, she&amp;rsquo;s smelly and gross, but she&amp;rsquo;s got a heart of gold! This collection collects over 100 strips for the first time, and his unmistakable blend of politically incorrect gags and social satire is as sharp as ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Steve Ditko Archives&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;238-Pages!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the Amazing Spider-Man and mysterious Dr. Strange, the legendary comic book artist Steve Ditko was conjuring all manners of horrors at his drawing table. In his first two years in the industry (1953 and1954), Ditko drew tales of macabre suspense that were not yet hobbled by the Comics Code Authority. These stories featured graphic bloodshed, dismemberment and blood-curdling acid baths as the ugly end to the lives of the dark and twisted inhabitants of Steve Ditko&amp;rsquo;s imagination. Strange Suspense: The Steve Ditko Archives Vol. 1 features, for the first time, spectacular full-color reprints of every story from those first two years of his career. Beginning with Ditko&amp;rsquo;s very first story to Ditko&amp;rsquo;s short stint in the Joe Simon/Jack Kirby studio, to Ditko&amp;rsquo;s eventual encampment at the Charlton Comics operation in 1954, readers will see the initial works of an artist already at a level of craftsmanship that exceeded most of his peers. The book also features editor Blake Bell&amp;rsquo;s insightful introduction, providing historical background and speaking to Ditko&amp;rsquo;s influence and his unique craft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Fantastic&amp;hellip; Raw and grotesque and beautifully drawn and presented.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Dave Gibbons&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Amateurs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A local medical expert and sheriff are summoned to investigate a strange sighting that sets the stage for Conor Stechschulte&amp;rsquo;s debut graphic novella: a severed human head that still seems to be talking. We flashback to a pair of butchers who arrive at work one morning to find not only that there is no meat in their shop but also that they have forgotten completely how to do their job. As customers arrive, they are too fearful for their livelihood to admit their dilemma, leading to increasingly disastrous events. But what has caused their strange amnesia? This often hilarious, enigmatic and uncomfortable book will establish Stechschulte as an exciting new talent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Toward a Hot Jew is a new high watermark in autobiographical comics and shows Miriam Libicki as a powerful witness to history in the tradition of Martjane Satrapi and Joe Sacco.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Pluck, an irritable and featherless rooster, and his best pal, the awkward-but-lovable teddy bear known as Fuzz, met long ago in a garbage truck. A tenuous―if decidedly co-dependent―friendship followed, sending them on a series of not-so-heroic adventures. But now, we find them on a ramshackle barge, slowly drifting out to sea. How did they get there? How will they escape?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The Gaze of Drifting Skies: A Treasury of Bird&amp;rsquo;s Eye Cartoon Views&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depicting the bustling crowds of humanity from magisterial heights was once a popular visual genre among artists and the public, regularly appearing in mass-market newspapers and magazines: carnivals and circuses, cook-outs and baseball games, bustling city streets and train stations or parades and epic battle scenes&amp;hellip; artists depicted the everyday life of urban and country settings where communities gathered for fun and revelry. Adults and children alike could spend hours delighting in the details of these marvelously orchestrated scenes of human bustle. This coffee-table collection showcases the remarkable beauty and breadth of these forgotten American classics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The Complete Wimmen&amp;rsquo;s Comix&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the late &amp;lsquo;60s, underground comix changed the way comics readers saw the medium ― but there was an important pronoun missing from the revolution. In 1972, ten women cartoonists got together in San Francisco to rectify the situation and produce the first and longest-lasting all-woman comics anthology,Wimmen&amp;rsquo;s Comix. Within two years the Wimmen&amp;rsquo;s Comix Collective had introduced cartoonists like Roberta Gregory and Melinda Gebbie to the comics-reading public, and would go on to publish some of the most talented women cartoonists in America ― Carol Tyler, Mary Fleener, Dori Seda, Phoebe Gloeckner, and many others. In its twenty year run, the women of Wimmen&amp;rsquo;s tackled subjects the guys wouldn&amp;rsquo;t touch with a ten-foot pole: abortion, menstruation, masturbation, castration, lesbians, witches, murderesses, and feminists. Most issues of Wimmen&amp;rsquo;s Comix have been long out of print, so it&amp;rsquo;s about time these pioneering cartoonists&amp;rsquo; work received their due.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Naked Cartoonists&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dream, of cartooning aficionados everywhere, revealed in hushed tones only within the cult itself, is to know what their favorite cartoonist looks like ―naked. Finally, a book that satisfies this unspoken fetish among cartoon fanatics. Presenting Naked Cartoonists: Over 70 artists’ nude self-portraits, including Sergio Aragonés, Art Spiegelman, Will Eisner, Charles Schulz, Mort Walker, Scott Adams, Al Jaffee, Ann Telnaes, Jeff Smith, Trina Robbins, Lynn Johnston, Russell Myers, and dozens more. Cartoonists are notoriously physically lovely, well-proportioned, statuesque, graceful, and always with a twinkle in their eyes, so in order not to make their readers envious or resentful, they often depict themselves in deliriously outlandish or humiliating situations and usually festooned with self-deprecating anatomical features. This is where cartoonists have to rely on nothing but their wit, inventiveness, and desperation to make themselves look as unattractive as humanly possible. In other words, as far from reality as they can possibly get. The cartoonists in this book succeed mightily at this gallant effort.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Messages in a Bottle: Comic Book Stories by B. Krigstein&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bernard Krigstein began his career as an unremarkable journeyman cartoonist during the 1940s and finished it as a respected fine artist and illustrator ― but comics historians know him for his explosively creative 1950s, during which he applied all the craft, intelligence and ambition of a burgeoning &amp;ldquo;serious&amp;rdquo; artist to his comics work, with results that remain stunning to this day. Krigstein&amp;rsquo;s legend rests mostly on the 30 or so stories he created for the EC Comics, but dozens of stories drawn for other, lesser publishers such as Rae Herman, Hillman, and Atlas (which would become Marvel) showcase his skills and radical reinterpretation of the comics page, in particular his groundbreaking slicing and dicing of time lapses through a series of narrow, nearly animated panels. Greg Sadowski, who has previously written and designed a Harvey Award-winning biography of Krigstein, has assembled the very best of Krigstein&amp;rsquo;s comics work, starting with his earliest creative rumblings, through his glory days at EC, to his final, even more brilliantly radical stories for Atlas Comics ― running through every genre popular at the time, be it horror, science fiction, war, western, or romance (but no super-heroes).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Lucky in Love: A Poor Man&amp;rsquo;s History&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Co-created by George L. Chieffet (script) and veteran cartoonist and animator Stephen DeStefano (plot and art), Lucky in Love is almost the flipside to dramatic works on the same theme such as Alan&amp;rsquo;s Warand You&amp;rsquo;ll Never Know. Elegantly drawn in a supremely confident, lively, cartoony black-and-white style that recalls Milt Gross as well as classic Disney animation and comics, Lucky in Love is a unique coming-of-age story that follows its lovable eponymous hero Lucky Testatuda from his rascally teen years in Hoboken, New Jersey&amp;rsquo;s Little Italy to his induction into the air force and subsequent wartime experiences. Lucky in Love shows what happens when a feisty young man merges his erotic fantasies with 1940s film myths: Moving from the &amp;lsquo;40s to present day (from which an aged, present-day Lucky looks back on his life), the book contrasts Lucky&amp;rsquo;s vivid fantasy life with the darker reality of World War II (including a masterful set-piece sequence that echoes Harvey Kurtzman&amp;rsquo;s classic EC war comics) as well as his first fumbling, cash-on-the-barrelhead sexual experiences. ultimately the poignant discoveries Lucky makes on his way to adulthood bestow upon him a very different kind of heroism than that of which he had dreamed&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;In a plague-ravaged medieval city, survival is a harsher fate than death. As corpses accumulate around her, Agnes, a young widow possessed of supernatural strength, must weigh her obligations to the dead and dying against her desire to protect what little remains.Laid Waste is a graphic novella about love and kindness among vermin in the putrid miasma at the end of the world. As with her evocative debut book, Black is the Color, Julia Gfrörer&amp;rsquo;s delicate, gothic drawing style perfectly complements the period era of the book&amp;rsquo;s setting, bringing the lyricism and romanticism of her prose to the fore.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Growing Up in Public&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ezequiel García explores the trials and tribulations of transitioning into his 30s as a working artist where the only thing more uncertain than the source of his next paycheck is the future of his hometown ― Buenos Aires. Garcia&amp;rsquo;s visual storytelling alternates among finely crafted, architecturally breathtaking depictions of Buenos Aires, revelatory, intimate self-examination, and phantasmorgical metaphorical flights, drawn in nuanced, expressive, grungy brush strokes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Glitz-2-Go&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glitz-2-Go finally collects nearly 40 years of comics stories by Diane Noomin, best-known for her work as cartoonist and editor of the women comics anthology Twisted Sisters. Noomin’s career in underground comix began in 1972 and included appearances in Wimmen’s Comix, Young Lust, Short Order, Arcade, Real Girl, Lemme Outta Here, El Perfecto, True Glitz, Aftershock, Mind Riot, Titters, and Weirdo. Glitz-2-Go stars Noomin’s signature character, DiDi Glitz, the frustrated middle-aged glamour-puss and anxiety-ridden suburban Sisyphus. All of her stories, beginning with her debut “Restless Reverie” in 1974’s Family Fun Comics, are finally back in print for the first time in over 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Ghosts and Ruins&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who doesn&amp;rsquo;t love a good ghost story? This gorgeous book is a compendium of old, forgotten haunted houses imagined by artist Ben Catmull, along with the stories and rumors of who haunts them, and why. Each spread features a different haunted house, lovingly and exquisitely rendered in scratchboard on masonite, with a short, nightmare-inducing description of each scene. In &amp;ldquo;Drowned Shelley,&amp;rdquo; for example: A chorus of frogs surrounds the house where young Shelley was drowned headfirst in the bathtub by her drunken stepfather. Say her name 13 times while looking in the pond and she will drown you in your sleep. Say her name the wrong number of times while looking in the pond, and she will leave hair in your breakfast dishes. Say her name 13 times while not looking in the pond, and she will watch you when you clip your toenails. Mispronounce her name 13 times while looking anywhere near the pond, and she will kick you somewhere delicate at the stroke of midnight. Catmull&amp;rsquo;s images are evocative, haunting masterpieces that never tread in graphic imagery, choosing instead to suggest horrors far more frightening than what they explicitly depict.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Gahan Wilson&amp;rsquo;s Out There&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gahan Wilson is probably best known for his macabre Playboy cartoons―filled with charming monsters, goofy mad scientists, and melting victims―and his cutting-edge work in the National Lampoon, but in 1964, he brought his brilliantly controlled wiggly-but-sophisticated pen line to The Magazine of Fantasy &amp;amp; Science Fiction. Wilson&amp;rsquo;s freaks and geeks found a home among the stories of the best fantasy and sf writers of the day, offering a welcome, if sometimes macabre or existentially imponderable, graphic break from the magazine&amp;rsquo;s otherwise straightforward prose. Wilson&amp;rsquo;s playfully black sense of comedy was on full display in these cartoons, delineated in his trademark roly-poly, sensual, delicately hatched line. Out There features the over 250 cartoons that Wilson drew during his tenure with the magazines as well as all four covers he rendered―none of which have seen the light of day since their first appearance 50 years ago. Wilson also contributed both short stories and movie and book reviews, which are included as well. Out There resurrects hundreds of virtually unseen cartoons by one of the 20th century&amp;rsquo;s masters of the form.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Gahan Wilson Sunday Comics&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gahan Wilson is probably best known for his macabre Playboy cartoons, filled with charming monsters, goofy mad scientists, and melting victims, and his cutting-edge work in the National Lampoon, but he&amp;rsquo;s also one of the most versatile cartoonists alive whose work has appeared in a wide range of media venues. Gahan Wilson Sunday Comics is Wilson&amp;rsquo;s assault from within: His little-known syndicated strip that appeared in America&amp;rsquo;s newspapers between 1974 an 1976. Readers must have been startled to find Wilson&amp;rsquo;s freaks, geeks, and weirdos nestled among family, funny-animal, and soap opera offerings. (The term &amp;ldquo;zombie strip&amp;rdquo; ― a strip that has long outlived its original creator ― takes on a whole new meaning in Wilson&amp;rsquo;s hands.) While each strip, at first glance, appears to be a standard, color Sunday strip (albeit without panel borders), each Sunday Comic is a collection of one-panel gag cartoons, delineated in Wilson&amp;rsquo;s brilliantly controlled wiggly-but-sophisticated pen line. The last gag cartoon on each Sunday is part of a recurring series, either &amp;ldquo;Future Funnies&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;The Creep.&amp;rdquo; Some Sundays are a freewheeling mélange of board meetings, monsters, and cavemen (with cameos by Wilson&amp;rsquo;s Kid character from Nuts, his gimlet-eyed view of childhood, collected last year by Fantagraphics), while others riff on a topic or subject (clocks, plants, wallpaper, etc.). As is his wont, Wilson mines the blackest of black comedy in the banal horror of human nature.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Education&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A father and son go on a road trip to discover train station relics, a professor explains his intricate grading methods, and a pen-pal correspondence gets more suggestive and dangerous. These are all interconnected in John Hankiewicz&amp;rsquo;s Education through reveries, memories, and nostalgic abstraction to tell a story that only the medium of comics could do justice. In this experimental and rewarding graphic novel, chronology and permanence are in flux while surreal illusions weave in and out of lucid states, remarkably held together by Hankiewicz&amp;rsquo;s confident, clean line and crosshatchings. Much like Here by Richard McGuire, Education is a time-fracture stream of consciousness told by a veteran cartoonist in his poetic prime.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Cork High and Bottle Deep&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virgil Partch, tutor to the tanked, scholar of the sloshed, professor to the plastered, and endowed with a scholarship from the School of Advanced Study of Alcoholic Endeavor, flung himself into months-long research of the most arduous kind in order to produce ― for our collective betterment ― this report on the hangover, and how one may acquire it. At the height of his career, working in quiet obscurity, Partch pursued his goal quietly and selflessly, often confining himself for long hours without food or sleep in dim, ill-ventilated holes-in-the- walls, doggedly researching, testing, rejecting, seeking no reward but that elusive ideal mixture to satiate one&amp;rsquo;s palate and wet one&amp;rsquo;s whistle. The foamy formula of excess (C2H5OH + homo sapiens) has created a combustible concoction that has long fueled sleepless nights, great passions, artistic achievement, and regretful mornings, but never before has it produced such inspired hilarity. Collecting the top shelf of VIP&amp;rsquo;s drink-themed artwork including well-known favorites, this new book is sure to delight even the most rigid teetotaler (and perhaps cause them to reconsider). So batten down the hooch and prepare to cast off on the stormy seas of booze with your faithful captain, Virgil Partch!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Chicago&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Harvey and Eisner-nominated cartoonist and editor Glenn Head comes Chicago, the hilarious and harrowing tale of a nineteen-year-old virgin who drops out of everything and into the unknown. Abandoning suburbia for art school and then the gritty streets of Chicago, young Glenn finds himself fending off street predators and fighting depression. A visit to the Playboy offices offers an entrance into the world of underground commix and R. Crumb, but it&amp;rsquo;s a chance encounter with Muhammad Ali that allows young Glenn to prove his mettle. Chicago is an unforgettable tale of losing one&amp;rsquo;s mind, finding one&amp;rsquo;s identity, and discovering love where it&amp;rsquo;s least expected.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Cheech Wizard&amp;rsquo;s Book of Me&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, at two-thirty in the afternoon, on the enchanted island of York, lived a Wizard… A mild-mannered, lovable Wizard who wore a big hat to mask his true identity… But just who is under the big hat, just who is… Cheech Wizard? Vaughn Bode created Cheech in 1956 at the age of 15 and the character remained a constant companion for the rest of Bode’s life, surfacing in his college paper, underground commix, the National Lampoon, and ultimately beyond into the cosmically collective world of graffiti and hip hop. The Big Book of Me brings this elemental, pop-essential corpus of transcendent art to the masses collecting all of the Cheech Wizard comics in a single volume.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Beta Testing the Apocalypse&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kaczynski takes abstract ideas — capitalism, communism, or utopianism &amp;ndash;and makes them tangible. He depicts and meditates on the immense political and technological structures and spaces we inhabit that subtly affect and define the limits of who we are and the freedom we as Americans presume to enjoy. Society and the individual, in perpetual tension. Once you&amp;rsquo;ve read Kaczynski&amp;rsquo;s comics, it should come as no surprise to learn that he studied architecture before embarking on a career as a cartoonist. Beta Testing includes 10 short stories, most notably &amp;ldquo;The New,&amp;rdquo; a brand new story created expressly for this book. It&amp;rsquo;s Kaczynski&amp;rsquo;s longest story to date. &amp;ldquo;The New&amp;rdquo; is set in an un-named third-world megalopolis. It could be Dhaka, Lagos or Mumbai. The city creaks under the pressure of explosive growth. Whole districts are built in a week. The story follows an internationally renowned starchitect as he struggles to impose his vision on the metropolis. A vision threatened by the massive dispossessed slum-proletariat inhabiting the slums and favelas on the edges of the city. From the fetid ferment of garbage dumps and shanties emerges a new feral architecture.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Beasts and Priests collects for the first time more than ten years&amp;rsquo; worth of pointillist portraiture of the world&amp;rsquo;s most legendary scene-makers Jim Blanchard.Much of the black-and-white ink work here has previously seen print in some of the world&amp;rsquo;s better alternative magazines and news weeklies, and portrait subjects include:Redd Foxx,Frank Sinatra, Curtis Mayfield, Raymond Chandler, Ennio Morricone, Bill Hicks, and Lenny Bruce. Blanchard&amp;rsquo;s work is often twisted, mutated and ultimately sickly gorgeous, with a pervasive psychedelic tone. Heavily influenced by such underground greats as Robert Williams and Victor Moscoso, Blanchard fuses meticulous craftsmanship with a pop underground sensibility to produce some of the most vivid and striking cartoon art in the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In 2016, comics intended for an adult readership are reviewed favorably in the New York Times, enjoy panels devoted to them at Book Expo America, and sell in bookstores comparable to prose efforts of similar weight and intent.Comics As Art: We Told You So is an oral history about Fantagraphics Books&amp;rsquo; key role in helping build and shape an art movement around a discredited, ignored and fading expression of Americana. It includes appearances by Chris Ware, Art Spiegelman, Harlan Ellison, Stan Lee, Daniel Clowes, Frank Miller, and more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The Lagoon&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A haunting, lyrical graphic novel debut. A family is seduced by the song of the Creature from the Black Lagoon in talented young cartoonist Lilli Carre&amp;rsquo;s first long-form work, and how each member reacts to the Creature&amp;rsquo;s siren call in The Lagoon is the crux of the story. Carre experimented with nib pens and brushes while drawing this black-and-white graphic novel, giving the art a different feel from her previous, Eisner-and-Harvey-Award-nominated story, The Tale of Woodsman Pete. Lagoon was influenced by the films Creature from the Black Lagoon and Night of the Hunter, but reads more like the gothic family narratives of Flannery O&amp;rsquo;Connor. Rhythms - taps, the ticking of a metronome - are punctuated by silences that pace this &amp;ldquo;sound&amp;rdquo;-driven story.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The Bill Everett Archives&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;70 years ago, a new publishing company named Marvel Comics stuck its toe into the first waters of the comic book industry. Before they became a pop culture powerhouse publishing famous superheroes like Spider-Man, the Incredible Hulk, and Iron Man, Marvel&amp;rsquo;s first ever comic book featured a daring new anti-hero named the Sub-Mariner, created by legendary artist Bill Everett. 70 years later, Everett&amp;rsquo;s watery creation continues to be one of the pinnacles of the Marvel Universe of superheroes, as attested to by its recent option as a major motion picture. Bill Everett invented comics&amp;rsquo; first anti-hero in 1939; an angry half-breed (half-man, half sea-creature) that terrorized mankind until uniting with the Allied Forces to conquer fascism&amp;rsquo;s march across Europe during World War II. But the reasons to celebrate Bill Everett&amp;rsquo;s monumental career in comics books don&amp;rsquo;t stop with his water-based hero. Everett was a master of many comic genres, and was one of the pre-eminent horror comic-book artists in the 1950s (before government and societal pressures led the comics industry to censor itself with the imposition of the Comics Code Authority), producing work of such quality and stature that he ranked alongside the artists who produced similar material for the justifiably lauded EC Comics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jessica Farm fuses serialized adventure, fantasy and psychological horror and stamps it with Josh Simmon’s signature macabre sensibility. Like a Lynchian take on Alice in Wonderland,Jessica Farmopens with an exterior of what could be any Midwestern farmhouse. Once inside, we track our titular heroine as she bounds out of bed on Christmas and goes about her morning routine, eventually breakfasting with her grandparents. The banality of the situation is subverted by a ratcheting sense of dread, as we discover that Jessica’s increasingly nightmarish house is filled with creatures around every corner: some whimsical, some sexual, some despairing and some malevolent. Most terrifying of all is Jessica’s father, whose promise of presents under the tree is loaded with the threat of violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Class Photo&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert Triptow stumbled across a real-life class photo of an anonymous 1937 public school under a pile of garbage and his imagination took off. Several years later, the result is the utterly charming, completely original graphic novella Class Photo. Using the photo as a springboard, each student’s fictionalized life is depicted in one-page installments. Triptow weaves these imagined lives in and out like so many dedications in a yearbook, mixing in social satire, elegant cartooning, occasionally disgusting hilarity, and plenty of good, clean fun. What began as a self-motivating formal exercise has yielded one of the more whimsically engaging, original, and entertaining graphic books in recent memory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Any Similarity to Persons Living or Dead is Purely Coincidental&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any Similarity&amp;hellip; is a collection of Drew Friedman&amp;rsquo;s earliest comic strips and illustrations, featuring his most obsessively stippled black-and-white panels and his most hilarious wise-guy takes on the stars and demi-stars and never-quite-stars of that swamp we like to call showbiz.In these strips, many of them written by his brother Josh Alan Friedman (both are sons of the legendary Bruce Jay Friedman: humor genes will tell!), the artist works out his obsession with such celebrities as Jim Nabors, Frank Sinatra Jr., Joe Franklin, Bob Hope, Andy Griffith&amp;hellip; and Ed Wood, Jr. film star Tor Johnson, whom Friedman actually catapulted back into some sort of semi-fame when these strips were first published in the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;VIP: The Mad World of Virgil Partch&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only a few months after the devastating attack on Pearl Harbor and the same year that Albert Camus offered the world his bleak vision of man’s existence by introducing his philosophical dictum of The Absurd, Virgil Partch burst onto the scene with his own twist on the phrase. Partch was a cartoonist who offered comic counterpoint to the grim headlines and a unique perspective on human nature in the pages of the nation’s most popular magazines. Known to millions by his jazzy signature, VIP, this comic genius ushered in a new era of the gag cartoon―zany, sometimes surreal, always hilarious―that inspired a generation of fellow cartoonists starting in the 1940s and ’50s. His madcap style of humor was reflected in the cutting-edge comedic sensibilities of Burns &amp;amp; Allen, Jack Benny, Ernie Kovacs, Bob &amp;amp; Ray, Stan Freberg, and Jean Shepherd, and would position Partch as one of the most prolific “gag-men” of his day. VIP contributed to an astonishing array of magazines, wrote gags for other cartoonists, illustrated books, album covers, and advertisements, and adorned merchandise including, appropriately, cocktail glasses.VIP: The Mad World of Virgil Partch is the first time Partch’s life and career has been treated in full, collecting amazing artwork from the entire range of his inspired career and featuring his own writings. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The Longest Day of the Future&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a futuristic city, two mega-companies share power, while indulging in a thankless war to eliminate the other, by any means necessary. The crash of an extraterrestrial flying saucer will, perhaps, change that. This masterfully crafted, witty and irreverent graphic novel is Argentine cartoonist and graphic designer Lucas Varela&amp;rsquo;s debut.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Escape From Special&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Escape from &amp;ldquo;Special&amp;rdquo; is the coming-of-age story of Melissa, who we first meet as a small child and depart from at the end of the book just before she enters high school. Drawn in black and white and washed in moody blues and full spectrum grays, Lasko-Gross&amp;rsquo;s art, with its detailed backgrounds and expressive characters, exquisitely conveys the story&amp;rsquo;s blend of humor (sometimes of the gross-out variety) and keenly observed insights. Miss Lasko-Gross, who has the sensibility of a love child of Linda Barry and David B. midwifed by Judy Blume, has created a graphic novel that should appeal not only to the growing readers of graphic novels, but to teens grappling with similar unresolved questions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Bright-Eyed At Midnight&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beginning at the stroke of midnight on January 1, 2014, and ending on January 1, 2015, Leslie Stein began drawing a comics page a night. Fueled by an urge toward visual and narrative experimentation and made possible by serendipitous bouts of insomnia, Stein has combined words and images in a series of comic strips, paintings, and collages that reflect her life.Bright-Eyed at Midnight collects the best of the 365 pages she&amp;rsquo;ll do in 2014: by turns funny, unsettling, charming, improvisational, honest, and evocative, Stein explores her 1980s childhood, dreams, her bar patrons, Jim Hendrix, travel, artist&amp;rsquo;s block, drinking, recording, rock shows, her siblings, amusement parks, moments of introspection, and loneliness in the most exciting city in the America. Drawn in pen and ink and vibrant watercolors, and written in a minimalist, poetic cadence, Bright-Eyed at Midnight is a thoughtful, meditative visual diary from an acclaimed cartoonist.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Beirut Won&amp;rsquo;t Cry&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BANG? BLOG! As bombs bombard his hometown of Beirut, thus begins the online diary of Mazen Kerbaj, a Lebanese painter, jazz musician, and cartoonist. Throughout the summer of 2006, during the Israeli attack on Lebanon, Kerbaj published drawings, comics, and writing giving a first-hand account of someone creating during a time of intense everyday brutality. Drawn and written in English, French, and Arabic, Beirut Won&amp;rsquo;t Cry shows us how an artist views the world and everything in it — his relationships, his family, and his creative pursuits — as it violently crumbles around him. Both historically vital and hilarious, Beirut Won&amp;rsquo;t Cry introduces Mazen Kerbaj&amp;rsquo;s unique voice and urgent pen to an American audience for the very first time, teaching readers how to carry on and resist in times of war and oppression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Artichoke Tales&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artichoke Tales is a coming-of-age story about a young girl named Brigitte whose family is caught between the two warring sides of a civil war, a graphic novel that takes place in a world that echoes our own, but whose people have artichoke leaves instead of hair. Influenced in equal parts byLittle House on the Prairie, The Thorn Birds, Dharma Bums, and Cold Mountain, Kelso weaves a moving story about family amidst war. Kelso&amp;rsquo;s visual storytelling, uniquely combining delicate linework with rhythmic, musical page compositions, creates a dramatic tension between intimate, ruminative character studies and the unflinching depiction of the consequences of war and carnage, lending cohesion and resonance to a generational epic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;In a way that only the medium of comics can, The Book of Hope slows the reader down to the rhythms of the life of a retired couple living in a rural countryside. Behind the static, routine moments of everyday life something bigger takes shape. Encroaching death stars to consume the husband, leading to visions and questions. This graphic novel from cartoonist Tommi Musturi is a thoughtful exploration of the human condition, filled with timeless humor and life itself. The strong presence of silence and nature reflect the arctic exotica of Musturi&amp;rsquo;s native Finland, but with a relatability, eloquence, and economy that will remind American readers of Chris Ware&amp;rsquo;s Jimmy Corrigan.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;God and Science: Return of the Ti-Girls&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally serialized in Love and Rockets: New Stories 1 &amp;amp; 2, &amp;ldquo;Ti-Girls Adventures&amp;rdquo; managed to be both a rollickingly creative super-hero joyride (featuring three separate super-teams and over two dozen characters) that ranged from the other side of the universe to Maggie&amp;rsquo;s shabby apartment, and a genuinely dramatic fable about madness, grief, and motherhood as Penny Century&amp;rsquo;s decades-long quest to become a genuine super-heroine are finally, and tragically, fulfilled. In addition to introducing a plethora of wild new characters, God and Science brings in many older characters from Jaime&amp;rsquo;s universe, some from seemingly throwaway shorter strips and some from Maggie&amp;rsquo;s day-to-day world (including some real surprises). The main heroine of the story, forming a bridge between the &amp;ldquo;realistic&amp;rdquo; Maggie stories and the super-heroic extravaganza is &amp;ldquo;Angel,&amp;rdquo; Maggie&amp;rsquo;s sweet-tempered and athletic new roommate and best friend, and now herself an aspiring super-heroine. Aside from being presented in a large format that really displays Jaime Hernandez&amp;rsquo;s stunning art, God and Science will be a &amp;ldquo;director&amp;rsquo;s cut&amp;rdquo; version that includes a full 30 new pages in addition to the original 100-page epic, including four new full-color faux Ti-Girls covers, several expansions of scenes, an epilogue set back in Maggie&amp;rsquo;s apartment, and a long fantasy/timewarp sequence that draws the focus back on Penny&amp;rsquo;s awful predicament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;For what&amp;rsquo;s essentially an evocative throwback to the kid&amp;rsquo;s superhero comics of yore, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot going on here&amp;ndash;youth versus seasoned oldsters, absolute power corrupting absolutely, mother/child dysfunction&amp;ndash;and it&amp;rsquo;s all wrapped up in a package of terrific dialogue, stellar artwork, and enough raw fun to drown in.&amp;rdquo; - Publishers Weekly&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;In The Chuckling Whatsit, Sala weaves the gothic cartooning traditions of Edward Gorey and Charles Addams with a densely constructed, melodramatic murder mystery involving astrology, ghouls, academia and outsider art. Part noir, part horror and part comedy, this labyrinthian tale of intrigue follows an unemployed writer named Broom who becomes unwittingly ensnared in a complex plot involving mysterious outsider artist Emile Jarnac, the shadowy machinations of the Ghoul Appreciation Society Headquarters (GASH), and the enigmatic Mr. Ixnay. Sala&amp;rsquo;s deadpan delivery makes this ingeniously layered narrative a roller-coaster ride of darkly pure comic suspense.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Then Gilbert Hernandez explodes with a similarly generous helping of his fantastically creative one-shot short stories: &amp;ldquo;Papa&amp;rdquo; (a turn-of-the-century story involving a traveling businessman); &amp;ldquo;The New Adventures of Duke and Sammy&amp;rdquo; (super-powered Martin and Lewis impostors in outer space); &amp;ldquo;Victory Dance&amp;rdquo; (Into the Wild as re-imagined by Beto); &amp;ldquo;Chiro el Indio&amp;rdquo; (written by third brother Mario Hernandez); &amp;ldquo;Never Say Never&amp;rdquo; (a kangaroo gets lucky in Las Vegas); and the mysterious wordless mood piece simply titled &amp;ldquo;?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The epic-length 50-page story (only the first half of the saga!) combines Jaime&amp;rsquo;s razor sharp characterization and superlative art with wildly inventive, Kirby-style slam-bang super-hero action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Gilbert Hernandez explodes with a similarly generous helping of his fantastically creative one-shot short stories: &amp;ldquo;Papa&amp;rdquo; (a turn-of-the-century story involving a traveling businessman); &amp;ldquo;The New Adventures of Duke and Sammy&amp;rdquo; (super-powered Martin and Lewis impostors in outer space); &amp;ldquo;Victory Dance&amp;rdquo; (Into the Wild as re-imagined by Beto); &amp;ldquo;Chiro el Indio&amp;rdquo; (written by third brother Mario Hernandez); &amp;ldquo;Never Say Never&amp;rdquo; (a kangaroo gets lucky in Las Vegas; and the mysterious wordless mood piece simply titled &amp;ldquo;?&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One hundred pages of Jaime, Gilbert and Mario Hernandez at the peak of their powers: this is a major graphic-novel event!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Castle Waiting&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Castle Waiting is the story of an isolated, abandoned castle, and the eccentric inhabitants who bring it back to life. A fable for modern times, it is a fairy tale that&amp;rsquo;s not about rescuing the princess, saving the kingdom, or fighting the ultimate war between Good and Evil &amp;ndash; but about being a hero in your own home. The opening chapter tells the origin of the castle itself, which is abandoned by its princess in a comic twist on &amp;ldquo;Sleeping Beauty&amp;rdquo; when she rides off into the sunset with her Prince Charming. The castle becomes a refuge for misfits, outcasts, and others seeking sanctuary, playing host to a lively and colorful cast of characters that inhabits the subsequent stories, including a talking anthropomorphic horse, a mysteriously pregnant Lady on the run, and a bearded nun. Linda Medley lavishly illustrates Castle Waiting in a classic visual style reminiscent of Arthur Rackham and William Heath Robinson. Blending elements from a variety of sources &amp;ndash; fairy tales, folklore, nursery rhymes &amp;ndash; Medley tells the story of the everyday lives of fantastic characters with humor, intelligence, and insight into human nature. Castle Waiting can be read on multiple levels and can be enjoyed by readers of all ages, especially young girls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Medley&amp;rsquo;s big book ranks with Jeff Smith&amp;rsquo;s Bone as a nearly-all-ages graphic-novel triumph.&amp;rdquo; - Booklist, &amp;ldquo;Core Collection: Graphic Women&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zanardi&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this graphic novel, presented in English for the first time, the Italian &amp;ldquo;Crumb&amp;rdquo; portrays a lost generation of late 1970s/early 1980s teenagers coping with family problems, school, sex, and drugs. A true visionary, with a fluid line and an uncanny sense of color and composition, Pazienza&amp;rsquo;s innovative graphic style served up stories that were iconoclastic, outrageous, humorous, and deeply personal, often based on himself and his microcosm of friends and collaborators. Pazienza was a revolutionary cartoonist who ushered an underground sensibility to Italian and European comics, breaking from the more staid tradition of genteel adult (and children&amp;rsquo;s) graphic albums.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Temperance&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do ideas of war and enemies hold a people together? Is a culture of conflict too seductive not to be irresistible? These are the questions Cathy Malkasian explores in her second graphic novel,Temperance. Malkasian creates, as she did in the critically acclaimed Percy Gloom, a fully realized, multi-layered world, inhabited by vividly realized characters. After a brutal injury in battle, Lester has no memory of his prior life. For the next thirty years his wife does everything to keep him from remembering―and re-constructing―a society, Blessedbowl, that elevates him as a hero. Blessedbowl is a cultural convergence of lies, memories, stories, and beliefs. Its people thrive on ideas of persecution, exceptionality, and enemies, convinced that war lurks just outside their walls. They have come to depend on Lester, their greatest war hero, to lead the charge once the Final Battle begins. Malkasian creates a densely textured social context, masterfully conveying the idiosyncratic physical domain with its spiraling structures and quasi-medieval architecture along with intimate yet plastic portraits of her characters in a rich, tonal pencil line. Temperance is a galvanizing work of empathy and violence by one of today&amp;rsquo;s the most thoughtful and accomplished cartoonists.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The Wolverton Bible&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cartoonist Basil Wolverton was known for his grotesque drawings, fantastically odd creatures, spaghetti-like hair, smoothly sculpted caricatures and insanely detailed crosshatching. His career in the golden age of comic books lasted from 1938 until 1952, after which his illustrations and caricatures extended into such publications as Life, Pageant and MAD magazines. Stylistically, he has been regarded as one of the spiritual grandfathers of underground and alternative comix. Less well known and understood is his work for the Worldwide Church of God, headed until 1986 by radio evangelist Herbert Armstrong. From 1953 through 1974, Wolverton, a deeply religious man, was commissioned and later employed by the church to write and illustrate a narrative of the Old Testament (including over 550 illustrations), some 20 apocalyptic illustrations inspired by the Book of Revelations, and dozens of cartoons and humorous illustrations for various Worldwide Church publications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;L.B. Cole created some of the most bizarre, proto-psychedelic, eye-popping comic book covers of all time, yet remarkably this is the first retrospective of his career, featuring the largest collection of Cole covers ever assembled, in an oversize format that showcases his attention to detail and his versatility in all the popular comic book genres of the day. Cole burst into comics during the glory years of the Golden Age of comics. He was famous for his bold covers, usually featuring &amp;ldquo;poster colors&amp;rdquo; ― brilliant primaries often over black backgrounds ― and an over-the-top sense of the bizarre mixed with whimsy. There&amp;rsquo;s never been a comic book cover designer like L.B. Cole and there&amp;rsquo;s never been a book like this one.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;21: The Story of Roberto Clemente&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;179-Pages!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of Library Journal&amp;rsquo;s Best Books 2011: Graphic Novels&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of Booklist&amp;rsquo;s Top 10 Graphic Novels: 2012 (for 2011 books)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;21 chronicles Roberto Clemente&amp;rsquo;s life from his early days growing up in rural Puerto Rico, the highlights of his career (including the 1960s World Series where he helped the Pirates win its first victory in 33 years, and his 3000th hit in 1972 during the last official at-bat of his life) as well as his private life and public mission off the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilfred Santiago captures the grit of Clemente&amp;rsquo;s rise from his impoverished Puerto Rican childhood, to the majesty of his performance on the field, to his fundamental decency as a human being in a drawing style that combines realistic attention to detail and expressive cartooning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Wilfred Santiago&amp;rsquo;s 21 is brilliant and beautiful, challenging and lyrical &amp;hellip; which seems exactly right, as Roberto Clemente was all those things and more.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Rob Neyer, ESPN.com&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A kaleidoscopic look at the life of the great Clemente. Santiago&amp;rsquo;s artwork is superb and the depth of his passion for the subject and incredible preparation comes through on every page.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Steven Goldman, author of Forging Genius: The Making of Casey Stengel and editor of Baseball Prospectus&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll admit, being a baseball player often feels like a comic book experience: the costumes, the origins, the battles for great victories and inspiration it conjures in our fellow man. This book captures the essence of one of our sport&amp;rsquo;s greatest heroes, and it does so in a way that engages the imaginations as much as it reveals the heart, ink, color, style, and character; I can think of no better way to share a tale of a true legend.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Dirk Hayhurst, Toronto Blue Jays pitcher and author of The Bullpen Gospels&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For the new millennium, there is MOME. This accessible, reasonably priced quarterly book will run approximately 136 pages per volume and spotlight a regular cast of a dozen of today&amp;rsquo;s most exciting cartoonists. Designed by acclaimed designer and cartoonist Jordan Crane, MOME will feature an iconic design and consistent format that should quickly establish the anthology as the most distinctive and accessible anthology of literary comics available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pin-Up Art of Bill Ward&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In those countless cheap and long forgotten men&amp;rsquo;s humor magazines, Ward&amp;rsquo;s voluptuous &amp;ldquo;girly&amp;rdquo; drawings shared the pages with photos of Bettie Page and Mamie Van Doren, and pin-up cartoons by the likes of Archie&amp;rsquo;s Dan DeCarlo and Playboy magazine&amp;rsquo;s Jack Cole. Thumbing through those digests, it quickly becomes evident that Ward was Humorama&amp;rsquo;s dominant pin-up cartoon artist. His mastery of the Conte crayon allowed him to produce unparalleled textures, including the wonderful sheen on satiny curve-hugging dresses and on black thigh-high stockings that became Ward trademarks. Ward&amp;rsquo;s other trademark, of course, was his penchant for drawing extremely well endowed women accentuated by tiny waists, and whether playing the role of office secretaries, arm candy at cocktail parties or vamping it up in a boudoir, his women played to multiple fetishes adorned in opera-length gloves, lacy lingerie, and five-inch stiletto heals. Sometimes bawdy, but never tawdry, Ward&amp;rsquo;s top-heavy Humorama women always managed to maintain their allure, innocence and glamour that made Torchy so popular.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Julio&amp;rsquo;s Day&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It begins in the year 1900, with the scream of a newborn. It ends, 100 pages later, in the year 2000, with the death-rattle of a 100-year-old man. The infant and the old man are both Julio, and Gilbert Hernandez&amp;rsquo;s Julio&amp;rsquo;s Day (originally serialized in Love and Rockets Vol. II but never completed until now) is his latest graphic novel, a masterpiece of elliptical, emotional storytelling that traces one life &amp;ndash; indeed, one century in a human life &amp;ndash; through a series of carefully crafted, consistently surprising and enthralling vignettes. There is hope and joy, there is bullying and grief, there is war (so much war &amp;ndash; this is after all the 20th century), there is love, there is heartbreak. This is very much a singular, standalone story that will help cement Hernandez&amp;rsquo;s position as one of the strongest and most original cartoonists of this, or any other, century. Introduction by novelist Brian Evenson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A haunting performance and about as perfect a literary work as I&amp;rsquo;ve read in years. Hernandez accomplishes in 100 pages what most novelists only dream of &amp;ndash; rendering the closeted, phlegmatic Julio in all his confounding complexity and in the process creating an unflinching biography of a community, a country and a century. A masterpiece.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Junot Díaz&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Treasury of Mini Comics&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Treasury of Mini Comics charts the evolution of the art of mini comics over four decades of deliberate cartoon rebellion. This volume will reproduce some of the best mini comics ever produced by some of the most creative DIY creators in the world (many of whom, of course, have gone on to become familiar names among contemporary comics connoisseurs): Leonard Rifas, Justin Green, Gary Arlington, Mark Connery, Jim Siergey, Larry Rippee, Richard Krauss, Bob Vojtko, Par Holman &amp;amp; Clark Dissmeyer, Matt Feazell, Matt Howarth, Steve Willis, Ronald Russell Roach, Edd Vick, Bruce Chrislip, Brad Johnson, Tim Corrigan, Macedonio Garcia, David Miller, Colin Upton, Robert Pasternak, David Lee Ingersoll, Roberta Gregory, John Porcellino, Dylan Williams, Eric Reynolds, Molly Keily, Blair Wilson, Jim Blanchard, Chris Cilla, David Lasky &amp;amp; Jim Woodring, Marc Bell, Ron Rege Jr., Leela Corman, David Heatley, Laura Wady, Fiona Smyth, Karl Wills, Onsmith, Travis Millard, Mark Campos, Nate Beaty, Peter Thompson, Carrie McNinch, Mark Todd, Esther Pearl Watson, Andy Singer, Noah Van Sciver, Kelly Froh, Aaron Norhanian, Max Clotfelter, and Marc J. Palm. In a do-it-yourself world, anything goes…boundaries are crossed, envelopes pushed, wounds opened. From the silliest fart or boob jokes to the most deeply felt “EMO” style poetry, mini comics creators have been uninhibited in their efforts to strive for something fresh, raw, and vital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Complete Peanuts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although there have been literally hundreds of Peanuts books published, many of the strips from the series&amp;rsquo; first two or three years have never been collected before―in large part because they showed a young Schulz working out the kinks in his new strip and include some characterizations and designs that are quite different from the cast we&amp;rsquo;re all familiar with. (Among other things, three major cast members―Schroeder, Lucy, and Linus―initially show up as infants and only &amp;ldquo;grow&amp;rdquo; into their final &amp;ldquo;mature&amp;rdquo; selves as the months go by. Even Snoopy debuts as a puppy!) Thus The Complete Peanuts offers a unique chance to see a master of the art form refine his skills and solidify his universe, day by day, week by week, month by month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Megahex&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Megg is a depressed, drug-addicted witch. Mogg is her black cat. Their friend, Owl, is an anthropomorphized owl. They hang out a lot with Werewolf Jones. This may sound like a pure stoner comedy, but it transcends the genre: these characters struggle unsuccessfully to come to grips with their depression, drug use, sexuality, poverty, lack of work, lack of ambition, and their complex feelings about each other in ways that have made Megg and Mogg sensations on Hanselmann&amp;rsquo;s Girl Mountain Tumblr. This is the first collection of Hanselmann&amp;rsquo;s work, freed from its cumbersome Internet prison, and sure to be one of the most talked about graphic novels of 2014, featuring all of the &amp;ldquo;classic&amp;rdquo; Megg and Mogg episodes from the past five years as well as over 70 pages of all-new material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Simon Hanselmann is the real deal, for sure. He captures that stoner stay-at-home life so accurately that I actually find his comics really depressing and thank god I don&amp;rsquo;t ever have to hang out with anybody like that ever again.&amp;rdquo; - Daniel Clowes&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Rebel Visions: The Underground Comix Revolution&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a provocative chronicle of the guerilla art movement that changed comics and popular culture forever. This comprehensive book follows the movements of about 50 artists from 1963 to 1975, the heyday of the underground comix movement. Through interviews with the participants and other materials, Rebel Visions is the most intimate look ever at the people and events that forged the phenomenon known as underground comix, from New York to San Francisco, from the corn belt to deep in the heart of Texas, beginning that day in 1968 when R. Crumb debuted Zap #1 from a baby carriage in San Francisco&amp;rsquo;s Haight-Ashbury district. Rosenkranz spent over 30 years researching this book and acquiring the cooperation of every significant underground cartoonist who worked throughout this period, including Crumb, Gilbert (Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers) Shelton, Bill (Zippy) Griffith, Art (Maus) Spiegelman, Jack Jackson, S. Clay Wilson, Robert Williams, and many more. The book is illustrated with many never-before-seen drawings by all of the underground cartoonists and exclusive photographs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Sex, Rock &amp;amp; Optical Illusions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sex, Rock &amp;amp; Optical Illusions is Victor Moscoso&amp;rsquo;s first major, career-spanning retrospective, from his earliest poster work in 1966 to his most recent graphic experimentation. Optical Illusions contains his best posters that advertised bands playing in San Francisco&amp;rsquo;s famous dance ballrooms of the time―the Avalon, the Matrix, and the Fillmoreas well as many of his Zap Comix contributions, and his solo comix work, many in Moscoso&amp;rsquo;s signature color. This wide-ranging career retrospective―Moscoso&amp;rsquo;s famous technique employing &amp;ldquo;vibrating colors&amp;rdquo; that he pioneered in his posters is impeccably reproduced with as much fidelity to the original as modern printing can achieve, his black-and-white and full color comix work is collected here for the first time is an intense, vibrant, and revelatory experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Gag On This: The Scrofulous Cartoons of Charles Rodrigues&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charles Rodrigues was one of the fiercest, most audacious, taboo-busting cartoonists who ever lived, and our second collection of his cartoons from the National Lampoon may be the most jaw-droppingly potent collection of single gag cartoons ever published. There was no subject Rodrigues wouldn&amp;rsquo;t tackle, and none that he couldn&amp;rsquo;t make funny. There is no example of human suffering, misery, tragedy, or absurdity that is off limits. If they weren&amp;rsquo;t as funny as they in fact are, they would be considered tasteless, repugnant, and horrifying―but without a drop of rancor, even the chapter titled &amp;ldquo;Good Ways to kill a Rock Performer.&amp;rdquo; There is virtually no way to adequately describe Rodrigues&amp;rsquo; viciously wicked imagination.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Simply Samuel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This graphic novel unfolds in front of the reader as a puzzle of short stories and moment-capturing images. Samuel is a pale, ghost-like character, drawn in clear line, against the controlled psychedelia of color and form. He exists almost invisible to his surroundings, a hero of the ordinary. Musturi&amp;rsquo;s precise storytelling is about individuality and loneliness among others, and of freedom, pondering our daily actions and the choices and values behind them, all evidenced by Samuel&amp;rsquo;s peculiar actions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Ray and Joe: The Story of a Man and His Dead Friend and Other Classic Comics&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fantagraphics is proud to announce the release of the first volume of another great, under-appreciated, quintessentially American cartoonist. &amp;ldquo;Black as sin and decay and perversion&amp;rdquo; is how National Lampooneditor Tony Hendra described the work of Charles Rodrigues. By all accounts, this small, politically conservative, devout Catholic, was a good-natured dumpling of a man. But inside lurked an untapped vein of savage wit that only the National Lampoon saw fit to unleash. Given carte blanche by its young editors, Rodrigues produced a 20-year tsunami of hilarious self-contained comic strips, themed gag spreads, and serials that boggled the mind and challenged all sense of decency and propriety. In this first-ever collection of his comics, readers are treated to the misadventures of conjoined twins The Aesop Brothers; Sam deGroot, a private detective in an iron lung (whose life actually gets worse when he is sprung from his enclosure); Deirdre Callahan, a girl so hideous that to look upon her causes madness and suicide; and the heartwarming (in relative terms) titular tale of Ray and Joe, the saga of a man and his dead best friend. Also included are his brilliant &amp;ldquo;biographies&amp;rdquo; of Marilyn Monroe, Abbie Hoffman, Eugene O&amp;rsquo;Neill, and others. Rodrigues rendered his cast of grotesqueries and naifs in a ragged, unpretty line within dense panels and pages, that perfectly reflects his uniquely bizarre, riotous and repellent world. Charles Rodrigues may be gone and, if not forgotten, insufficiently remembered, and this collection will rectify at least one of those tragedies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Dörfler&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set in a dystopian future, alternating between current time and flashbacks, between an urban environment and a natural landscape, Dörfler is as much about space and time as it is about the characters who inhabit the two landscapes. Strange inter-dimensional creatures live in the ancient lands of the Northern Mountains, where electronic and engine powered machinery is rendered inoperable. The city is a police state where the military subjects its citizens to experiments that turn memory and identity into malleable, political tools. While one woman wreaks havoc against the totalitarian state in revenge for what they&amp;rsquo;d done to her, two lovers wander through the Northern Mountains trying to distinguish between real and false memories. The towering landscapes, reflected in the very dimensions of the book itself, play an important role in the story-dizzying skyscrapers of rock formations and trees in contrast to the desolate, vertiginous cityscape that looks like a decaying version of Fritz Lang&amp;rsquo;s Metropolis. A bold and sure to be talked-about debut graphic novel.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Wuvable Oaf&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Sex and the City but with adorable, ex-wrestler hairy gay men (or bears), Wuvable Oaf is Luce&amp;rsquo;s debut graphic novel. This book fills a romance comics hole by portraying a likeable gay male character that is both fully realized and relatable. Mostly playful, but sometimes serious, Wuvable Oaf captures the levity of loneliness. Luce delivers a rom-com that would leave Zack Galifianakis and Zooey Deschanel feuding over who got to play Oaf in a hypothetical movie adaptation. Oaf is a large, hirsute, scary-looking ex-wrestler who lives in San Francisco with his adorable kitties, and listens to a lot of Morrissey. The book follows Oaf&amp;rsquo;s search for love in the big city, especially his pursuit of Eiffel, the lead singer of the black metal/queercore/progressive disco grindcore band Ejaculoid. Luce weaves friends, associates, enemies, ex-lovers, and the pasts of both men into the story of their courtship. Like Scott Pilgrim, Love and Rockets, and Archie, Wuvable Oaf explores the joys and pains of romantic conquests, set against the backdrop of the San Francisco scene. After decades of comics about boy-loves-girl, Luce finally gives readers of all orientations some insight into man-loves-man. Oaf&amp;rsquo;s silly, sweet, and sometimes sexy stories will win over everyone&amp;rsquo;s heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The issues are fast paced, funny and chock full of pop-culture references. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re gay/straight/something in between, I think you&amp;rsquo;ll find yourself rooting for the Oaf and his quest for somebody to wuv.&amp;rdquo; -Pop Candy&amp;rsquo;s Whitney Matheson&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The Hypo: The Melancholic Young Lincoln&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;192 pages!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The debut graphic novel from Noah Van Sciver follows the twentysomething Abraham Lincoln as he loses everything, long before becoming our most beloved president. Lincoln is a rising Whig in the state&amp;rsquo;s legislature as he arrives in Springfield, IL to practice law. With all of his possessions under his arms in two saddlebags, he is quickly given a place to stay by a womanizing young bachelor who becomes his friend and close confidant. Lincoln builds a life and begins friendships with the town&amp;rsquo;s top lawyers and politicians. He attends elegant dances and meets an independent-minded young woman from a high-society Kentucky family, and after a brisk courtship, becomes engaged. But, as time passes and uncertainty creeps in, young Lincoln is forced to battle a dark cloud of depression brought on by a chain of defeats and failures culminating into a nervous breakdown that threatens his life and sanity. This cloud of dark depression Lincoln calls &amp;ldquo;The Hypo.&amp;rdquo; Dense crosshatching and an attention to detail help bring together this completely original telling of a man driven by an irrepressible desire to pull himself up by his bootstraps, overcome all obstacles, and become the person he strives to be. All the while unknowingly laying the foundation of character he would use as one of America&amp;rsquo;s greatest presidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Noah Van Sciver has brought new soul to this hard, weird time in Lincoln&amp;rsquo;s life. The Hypo is a story of suffering &amp;amp; yearning, artfully told.&amp;rdquo; - Joshua Wolf Shenk, author of Lincoln&amp;rsquo;s Melancholy&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Dry humor and psychedelia are grounded in realistic emotion in this quirky and surprising graphic novel debut following the adventures of a young woman named Larrybear and her best friend, a talking acoustic guitar named Marshmallow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Stein gives us the slackerly, star-eyed alternative to a cadre of &amp;lsquo;misanthropic, self-pitying comics about unappreciated cartoonists,&amp;rsquo; as Tom De Haven characterized it&amp;hellip; But where the aforementioned Crumb-descended misanthropes have all more or less grown up, Stein&amp;rsquo;s Larrybear is a naïve woman on the verge of Whatever, a cute Candide floundering about in an increasingly complicated world. &amp;hellip;[T]his book [is] such a pleasure&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Richard Gehr, The Comics Journal&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Doctors&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new graphic novel from acclaimed cartoonist Dash Shaw (Bottomless Belly Button, BodyWorld, New School) is his most taut book to date. Dr. Cho is the creator of the Charon, a device that allows his staff to enter a dead patient&amp;rsquo;s afterlife by taking the form of a memory in the patient&amp;rsquo;s consciousness, and bring him or her back to life, with one catch: the experience is traumatic and the process kills them again soon thereafter. But for some bereaved, the opportunity is priceless. So when Bell is killed in a random accident, her daughter hires Dr. Cho&amp;rsquo;s team to bring her back. But what if Bell didn&amp;rsquo;t want to come back? The dying unconsciously create the afterlife they want, or feel they deserve, in their minds before everything fades to black. Isn&amp;rsquo;t that better than the reality, and no less meaningful than life itself? Can unconsciousness coexist with consciousness? Part science-fiction thriller, part family drama, part morality play for the 21st century, and quite possibly Shaw&amp;rsquo;s best book to date.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Casey at the Bat and Other Diamond Tales&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1953, in conjunction with the fiftieth anniversary of the World Series, legendary cartoonist Willard Mullin created images illustrating one of America&amp;rsquo;s best-loved poems: Ernest Thayer&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Casey at the Bat.&amp;rdquo; These images were then put on a series of drinking glasses that were given away as premiums at various major and minor league ballparks across America. The first set was issued on April 15, 1954, at the very first home game for the modern day Baltimore Orioles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The illustrations by Mullin were for years thought to have been lost, but were found at an auction in 2002. They have been meticulously reproduced to create this stunning edition of &amp;ldquo;Casey at the Bat.&amp;rdquo; This edition will include additional Mullin material like the &amp;ldquo;Fan&amp;rsquo;s Alphabet&amp;rdquo; from 1953 and the poems &amp;ldquo;Iron Horse Lou&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;O Brooklyn, My Brooklyn&amp;rdquo; from 1947. With a preface by Yogi Berra and an essay on the history of both &amp;ldquo;Casey&amp;rdquo; and Mullin&amp;rsquo;s images by noted baseball historian Tim Wiles, this edition of &amp;ldquo;Casey&amp;rdquo; is the most authentic ever produced. A keepsake for the ages.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Black River&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Josh Simmons returns with his first full-length graphic novel since 2007&amp;rsquo;s acclaimed House. A group of women, one man, and two dogs are making their way through a post-apocalyptic world in search of a city that supposedly still has electricity and some sort of civilization. Along the way, they go to a comedy club, take a drug called Gumdrop, and encounter gangs of men who are fools, lunatics, or murderous sadists. In other words, all manner of terrors. Josh Simmons is one of the field&amp;rsquo;s most distinctive voices in the genre of horror (The Furry Trap, House), and this full-length graphic novel is his best work yet, echoing director John Carpenter&amp;rsquo;s perfect tick-tock pacing, as well as Shirley Jackson&amp;rsquo;s ability to transcend genre and turn it into literature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Josh Simmons has concocted a hellish world in which madwomen roam a post-apocalyptic landscape - but its battlescars are nothing compared to the self-obliterating hell of their own minds. A horrifying, unforgettable vision.&amp;rdquo; - Kier-La Janisse (House of Psychotic Women)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Today Is the Last Day of the Rest of Your Life&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GRAPHIC CONTENT WARNING: Ulli Lust&amp;rsquo;s sprawling, vivid autobiography depicts the trials and tribulations of a teen runaway with the unflinching honesty one would expect from the self-portrait she paints on the page. Frank discussions of sexuality and other adult material are important parts of her story, and as such, reader discretion is strongly advised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A long, dense, sensitive, and minutely observed autobiographical masterpiece recalling the summer of 1984, when the artist, a rebellious, punked-out 17-year-old, hitchhiked her way across Italy. 2011 Angoulême prize winner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Left Bank Gang&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, Ezra Pound, and James Joyce walk into a Parisian bar&amp;hellip; no, it&amp;rsquo;s not the beginning of a joke, but the premise of Jason&amp;rsquo;s unique new graphic novel. Set in 1920s Paris, The Left Bank Gang is a deliciously inventive re-imagining of these four literary figures as graphic novelists! Yes, in Jason&amp;rsquo;s warped world, cartooning is the dominant form of fiction, and not only do these four literary giants work in the comics medium but they get together to discuss  the latest graphic novels from Dostoevsky to Faulkner (&amp;ldquo;Hasn&amp;rsquo;t he heard of white space? His panels are too crowded!&amp;rdquo;), and bemoan their erratic careers. With guest appearances by Zelda Fitzgerald and Jean-Paul Sartre, and a few remarkable twists and turns along the way, and you&amp;rsquo;ve got one of the funniest and most playful graphic novels of the year. Like Jason&amp;rsquo;s acclaimed Why Are You Doing This?, The Left Bank Gang is rendered in full spectacular color.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Cross Ingmar Bergman with Walt Kelly and Raymond Carver and you may have some idea of what Norwegian cartoonist Jason&amp;rsquo;s work is like&amp;hellip; one of the medium&amp;rsquo;s finest storytellers.&amp;rdquo; - Publishers Weekly&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Jim is a mind-bending collection of all of Woodring&amp;rsquo;s best non-Frank creative work - comics stories, prose stories, drawings, and paintings, with a new introduction and afterword by the man himself.

&lt;p&gt;Hey, Wait&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This superbly evocative graphic novella by the award-winning Norwegian cartoonist Jason (his first appearance in the English language) starts off as a melancholy childhood memoir and then, with a shocking twist midway through, becomes the summary of lives lived, wasted, and lost. Like Art Spiegelman did with Maus, Jason utilizes anthropomorphic stylizations to reach deeper, more general truths, and to create elegantly minimalist panels whose emotional depth charge comes as an even greater shock. His sparse dialogue, dark wit, and supremely bold use of &amp;ldquo;jump-cuts&amp;rdquo; from one scene to the next (sometimes spanning a number of years) make Hey, Wait&amp;hellip; a surprising and engaging debut. Love and Rockets co-creator Gilbert Hernandez calls this one of the best graphic novels ever.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Fran&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is to become of the beloved trilobular chuckbuster Frank now that he has journeyed outside the Unifactor and met his soulmate, Fran? The answer is delivered here in devastatingly unpredictable fashion. Fans of Frank, connoisseurs of bizarre romance, and spelunkers in the radiant depths of graphic metaphysical psychodrama will want to add this singular cartoon adventure story to their lifetime reading list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;a simultaneous prequel and sequel to Jim Woodring&amp;rsquo;s excellent Congress of the Animals from 2011, a book which seemed to shatter the cyclical exploits of the artist&amp;rsquo;s Frank universe so as to provide an ending of sorts, though surely you want to know more about that nice friend Frank shacked himself up with for the denouement&amp;rdquo; -Joe McCulloch, The Comics Journal&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Athos In America&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A collection of full-color graphic novellas, Athos in America takes its title from the lead story, a prequel of sort to the graphic novel The Last Musketer, in which the seemingly ageless swashbuckler turns up in a bar in 1920 New York and relates the tale of how he went to Hollywood to play himself in a film version of The Three Musketeers. Also included: &amp;ldquo;The Brain That Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t Virginia Woolf,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Tom Waits on the Moon,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;So Long Mary Ann.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;When I read Jason for the first time, I was just as excited and devastated as the first time I read the poems of Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman. Jason&amp;rsquo;s work is poetry.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Sherman Alexie&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Spacehawk&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;274-Pages!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basil Wolverton is one of the greatest, most idiosyncratic talents in comic book history. Though he is best known for his humorous grotesqueries in MAD magazine, it is his science-fiction character Spacehawk that Wolverton fans have most often demanded be collected. The wait is over, as Spacehawk features every story from Spacehawk&amp;rsquo;s intergalactic debut in 1940 to his final, Nazi-crushing adventure in 1942. Spacehawk is the closest thing to a colorfully-costumed, conventional action hero Wolverton ever created, yet the strip is infused with Wolverton&amp;rsquo;s quintessential weirdness: controlled, organic artwork of strangely repulsive aliens and monsters and bizarre planets, and stories of gruesome retribution that bring to mind Wolverton&amp;rsquo;s peer, Fletcher Hanks. Spacehawk had no secret identity, no fixed base of operations beyond his spaceship, and no sidekicks or love interests. He had but one mission in life: to protect the innocent throughout the Solar System, and to punish the guilty. He was a dark &amp;ndash; yet much more visually playful &amp;ndash; counterpart to Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon. Spacehawk also includes the character&amp;rsquo;s final and rarely-seen Earthbound adventures. As the U.S. became involved in World War II, Spacehawk returned to 20th Century America to join the United States&amp;rsquo; efforts in defeating fascism, which he does by patrolling the Earth&amp;rsquo;s stratosphere, looking for wrongdoing.

&lt;p&gt;Inner City Romance&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guy Colwell&amp;rsquo;s Inner City Romance tread new territory for underground comix, filled with stories about prison, black culture, ghetto life, the sex trade, and radical activism. It portrayed the unpleasant realities of life in the inner city, where opportunities were limited and being on the lowest end of the economic ladder meant that one&amp;rsquo;s vision of the American dream was more about survival than lifestyle choices. Readers wondered who Colwell was, whether he was black or white, and how he knew so much about prison. Two years at McNeil Island federal prison for draft refusal provided a personal education for him, as well as his involvement with the San Francisco Good Times underground newspaper, where he became a close observer of the White Panthers, the Symbionese Liberation Army, and anti-war demonstrations. Inner City Romance details Colwell&amp;rsquo;s life on the mean streets. Every issue of Inner City Romance is included in this collection, as well as many of the highly detailed paintings he created at the same time. Colwell recounts in an accompanying text piece, his personal journey to artistic maturity forged by radicalism and frustration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This 1972 underground comic was one of the first to engage the racial divide boiling over during the peace and love era. Colwell&amp;rsquo;s series is a brutal comedown. His characters, fucked up on drugs and gorging themselves on sex, debate the social issues of the day. Essential, incredible work.&amp;rdquo; -Dan Nadel&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Lovf: An Illustrated Vision Quest of a Man Losing His Mind&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOVF is the sketchbook companion of a man literally losing his mind. Homeless and broke after giving all his stuff to punk-rock heroin dealers, he ends up off his meds and on a secret quest from Portland to Brooklyn, DC, LA, San Francisco, and Seattle. Jammed with cartoons, mad schemes, psychedelic portraits, and notes from the road, LOVF is a travel journal and a mirror of the post-traumatic dreamworld its author can&amp;rsquo;t escape from, a Kerouacian meltdown of cross-hatching, spattered marker, crayons, glitter, tape, nail polish, Wite-Out, finger-painting, rain, wine, stickers, and word balloons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;New School&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this brand new graphic novel from the acclaimed author of Bottomless Belly Button and BodyWorld, Dash Shaw dramatizes the story of a boy moving to an exotic country and his infatuation with an unfamiliar culture that quickly shifts to disillusionment. A sense of &amp;ldquo;being different&amp;rdquo; grows to alienation, until he angrily blames this once-enchanting land for his feelings of isolation. All of this is told through the fantastical eyes of young Danny, a boy growing up in the &amp;lsquo;90s fed on dramatic adventure stories like Jurassic Park and X-Men. Danny&amp;rsquo;s older brother, Luke, travels to a remote island to teach English to the employees of ClockWorld, an ambitious new amusement park that recreates historical events. When Luke doesn&amp;rsquo;t return after two years, Danny travels to ClockWorld to convince Luke to return to America. But Luke has made a new life, new family, and even a new personality for himself on ClockWorld, rendering him almost unrecognizable to his own brother. Danny comes of age as he explores the island, ClockWorld, and fights to bring his brother home. New School is unlike anything in the history of the comics medium: at once funny and deadly serious, easily readable while wildly artistic, personal and political, familiar and completely new.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The mysterious Dr. Z has enlisted three space heroes to search the galaxy for the fabled Twelve Gems of Power: the hulking alien-brawn Furz; the beautiful and deadly sabre-wielding Venus; and the soft-spoken canine technician, Dogstar. They meet many strange and storied characters on their journey, but none so strange or sinister as their dear benefactor himself. With a heavy dose of humor and wall-to-wall action, this is one of the most action-packed and funny books of the year.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The Red Monkey Double Happiness Book&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set in sun-drenched Cape Town, South Africa, this book features two full-length stories, &amp;ldquo;The Leaking Cello Case&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;John Wesley Harding,&amp;rdquo; rife with mystery, suspense, action, adventure, conspiracy theories, cool cars and excellent weed. Joe Daly brings a refreshingly original &amp;ndash; and utterly hilarious &amp;ndash; voice to the comics medium, a dry, deadpan wit anchored in everyday reality combined with unnervingly deranged plots, rendered with a hyper-detailed, half-realistic and half-cartoony Tintin-style crispness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;[The Red Monkey Double Happiness Book] is basically Herge by way of the Big Lebowski with a little bit of Repo Man thrown in for good measure&amp;hellip;. very funny&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Chris Mautner, Robot 6&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Folly: Consequences of Indiscretion&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;161 pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This digital edition includes an exclusive collaboration between Hans&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rickheit and Ria called &amp;ldquo;Sigmund Freud,&amp;rdquo; a tribute to Jack Kirby which does&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;not appear in the print edition!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lovers of art comics know Hans Rickheit from his smashing graphic novel The Squirrel Machine (2008), but Rickheit has, for over a decade, been reaching into the deepest cupboards of the back-mind with his comics.Originally distributed into the world as Xeroxed pamphlets, these &amp;ldquo;underground comix&amp;rdquo; reflect the true nature of its nomenclature: Here are the archeological findings of the subterranean ruins of the psyche. Finally, these scattered elements have been compiled into a compact, lushly illustrated bedside reader. Give your cerebellum a tug and become a spelunker of the subconscious as we trespass among the scorched archaic wastelands of the offspring of apes and fools. Here we find the profane, beautiful progeny of prurient ideals. Immerse yourself in the nocturnal meanderings of unnamed protagonists. Ponder the uncomfortable sexuality of the twins, Cochlea &amp;amp; Eustachia. Recoil at the doings of a dwarfish malefactor in &amp;ldquo;Hail Jeffrey,&amp;rdquo; or simply stare at the pretty pictures. Suffice to say that readers of The Squirrel Machine will not be disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Barack Hussein Obama&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;113 pages!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to live in America today? If you know there&amp;rsquo;s no right answer to that question, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to read Barack Hussein Obama &amp;ndash; a book about you; about your country, your family, your president. Barack Hussein Obama is not a graphic novel. It&amp;rsquo;s neither a biography nor an experiment, but a whole, fully-realized parallel America, a dada-esque, surrealistic satirical vision that is no more cockeyed than the real thing, its weirdness no more weird, its vision of the world no more terrifying, where the zombie-esque simulacra of Joe Biden and Hillary and Newt and Obama wander, if not exactly through the corridors of power, through an America they made and have to live in, like it or not. American cartoonist Steven Weissman takes from the lives of the leader of the free world, his friends, his family, his sworn enemies, and gives them a new life that is both withering and oblique, devastating and contemplative, chaotic and pellucid. Before you lose your will to vote, read Barack Hussein Obama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Barack Hussein Obama is brave, smart, humane, exciting and funny.&amp;rdquo; - Bill Kartalopoulos&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Three full-color short stories exploring varied dystopian societies, from a Sherlock Holmes-style investigator who must complete his high school degree to filmed &amp;ldquo;voluntary&amp;rdquo; nudity to prison camps full of jaded children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man Who Grew His Beard&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Man Who Grew His Beard is Belgian cartoonist Olivier Schrauwen&amp;rsquo;s first American book after having staked a reputation as one of Europe&amp;rsquo;s most talented storytellers. It collects seven short stories, each a head-spinning display of craft and storytelling that mixes early twentieth-century comics influences like Winsor McCay with a thoroughly contemporary voice that provokes and entertains with subversively surreal humor and subtle criticism of twentieth-century tropes and images. The stories themselves, though each stands alone, are intertwined thematically, offering peeks into the minds of semi-autistic, achingly isolated men and their feverish inner worlds and how they interact and contrast with their real environment. Though Schrauwen taps &amp;ldquo;surrealist&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;absurdist&amp;rdquo; impulses in his work, you will not read a more careful and precise collection of stories this year. The stories included are: &amp;ldquo;Hair Types,&amp;rdquo; a hilarious piece that on the surface explores the pseudoscientific classification of personality as a function of hair but becomes something more akin to a fable about self-fulfilling prophecy; &amp;ldquo;Chromo Congo,&amp;rdquo; a silent story about two men on safari who meet a corpulent and obnoxious hunter; as well as &amp;ldquo;The Task,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;The Man Who Grew His Beard,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;The Lock,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;The Cave,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;The Imaginist.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The Kurdles&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of Hergé&amp;rsquo;s Tintin or Carl Barks&amp;rsquo; Uncle Scrooge, The Kurdles is an all-ages comic spiced up with a teaspoon of strange. Sally is a teddy bear who gets separated from her owner while on a drive in the country. Desperate to find her way home, she stumbles upon Kurdleton, home to a most peculiar group of characters in the midst of a crisis; their forest house has grown hair, eyes, and a mouth! The creatures work with their new friend to keep Kurdleton from growing legs and running away! Goodin, an animation industry veteran (American Dad, Rugrats), delivers a timeless classic in his debut graphic novel, introducing an unforgettable and charming cast of characters. Printed in an oversized format to showcase Goodin&amp;rsquo;s stunning, hand-painted artwork, The Kurdles will capture the imagination of both parents and children.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Terror Assaulter (O.M.W.O.T.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cartoonist Benjamin Marra brilliantly satirizes America&amp;rsquo;s obsession with justice - and disinterest in consequences - via a highly stylized, hyper-masculine style that gushes with violence, sex, and international intrigue, battering down the boundaries between psychedelia, political commentary, and aggressive expressionism. Terror Assaulter must defeat terror at all costs, as long as it leaves time for steamy dates with hot chicks. The man&amp;rsquo;s codename is O.M.W.O.T. (One Man War On Terror) and his the world&amp;rsquo;s greatest protector, and a villain&amp;rsquo;s worst nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Dumb&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part memoir, part medical cautionary tale, Dumb tells the story of how an urban twentysomething copes with the everyday challenges that come with voicelessness. Webber adroitly uses the comics medium to convey the practical hurdles she faced as well as the fear and dread that accompanied her increasingly lonely journey to regain her life. Her raw cartooning style, occasionally devolving into chaotic scribbles, splotches of ink, and overlapping montages, perfectly captures her frustration and anxiety. But her ordeal ultimately becomes a hopeful story. Throughout, she learns to lean on the support of her close friends, finds self-expression in creating comics, and comes to understand and appreciate how deeply her voice and identity are intertwined.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

A sociopathic boxcar hobo, a young man who sprouts worms from his face, an undocumented immigrant bookstore doorman, a former boxer and an expert hustler all populate a haunted landscape of broken dreams.

&lt;p&gt;Leaf&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How much power does a single man, let alone a single leaf, have in the industrial world? In this wordless, all-ages graphic novel, our protagonist discovers a leaf that radiates a vibrant light. He returns to a detailed metropolis - depicted in somber grays and blues - and searches for answers. During his quest, he stumbles upon a man who knows what&amp;rsquo;s really happening in the city&amp;rsquo;s labyrinthine ducts; a woman who spends her life studying and classifying obsolete flora; and the truth about the ever-dwindling environment. Leaf is a graphically stunning story that unfolds with a dream-like pace. Shaded in pencil and punctuated by spot colors, drawn in a delicate but concretely realized tonal approach reminiscent of Shaun Tan&amp;rsquo;s The Arrival and Chris Van Allsburg&amp;rsquo;s Jumanji, Chinese cartoonist Daishu Ma&amp;rsquo;s first foray onto American shelves is ultimately a hopeful vision of the coexistence of the urban and natural worlds.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;If You Steal&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jason&amp;rsquo;s latest collection of full color comics indulges in his light and playful side, consisting of eleven wildly off-kilter stories that mix incongruous elements of pop culture and a variety of genres, pastiches and mash-ups in a delightful soupcon of graphic storytelling. Frida Kahlo is a hired killer. Santo, the Mexican wrestling film star, faces his ultimate challenge. The rise and fall of Chet Baker-told in six pages. Night of the Vampire Hunter. The last word on the JFK assassination conspiracies. A non-linear heist story that also somehow includes images by Magritte. A big bug story based on 1950s black-and-white films. And what would Van Morrison&amp;rsquo;s Moondance album look like if it was a horror comic? All as foretold by Nostradamus, of course. And all told by Jason, whose sly and elusive meanings are hidden beneath a beguilingly deadpan style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fante Bukowski&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noah Van Sciver&amp;rsquo;s latest graphic novel drops in on the life of the self-styled, aspiring young writer, Fante Bukowski, as he delusively makes his way to literary fame and fortune, one drink at a time. Living in a cheap hotel, consorting with the debased and downtrodden, searching for that golden idea that will rocket him to the success he yearns for as the great American novelist, and to get respect from his father once and for all. But, there&amp;rsquo;s just one problem: Fante Bukowski has no talent for writing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Creeping Death from Neptune&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first of two volumes reprinting copious amounts of comics stories and recounting the career of cartoonist Basil Wolverton. Based on his correspondence and journals, the biographical portion of the books follows Wolverton from childhood to adult day-to-day life as freelance cartoonist, itinerant handyman, persistent contest enterer, and local pastor of the Radio Church of God. Wolverton lived and worked in the Pacific Northwest, unique among the first generation of comic book pioneers. In the precious period before the industry calcified into a commercial institution, Wolverton was free to work under the radar to explore in detail his weird tales of the future. All of Wolverton&amp;rsquo;s non-humorous comic book stories will be presented in full, along with prime examples of his humorous comics and dozens of pages of unpublished art, including editorial drawings, advertisements, caricatures, pulp illustrations, rejected comic book covers, and unsold features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s remarkable to see art so twisted applied to such vivid pulp tales - almost as though Wolverton was trying his hardest to be Alex Raymond, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t help turning out images to rival Salvador Dalí.&amp;rdquo; - The A.V. Club&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The Late Child and Other Animals&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hetty survives the bombing of Portsmouth by the Nazis in World War II, only to learn that her soldier husband - with whom she was in the process of adopting a young daughter - has been killed on the way back home from North Africa. She must then complete the adoption alone. A decade later, she gives birth to a bastard daughter, Marguerite. Now Hetty must go before a tribunal to prove that she is a fit mother - or possibly lose both her children. From there, The Late Child and Other Animals tells the story of little Marguerite&amp;rsquo;s childhood in the recovering British naval port and the rural beauty of the Isle of Wight and in Normandy, France. The journeys and struggles over decades of this mother and daughter are linked in five episodes that veer between lyricism, wry wit, and harrowing suspense. The Late Child and Other Animals is an original graphic novel, a generational autobiography written by legendary punk diva and award-winning poet Marguerite Van Cook, adapted by artist James Romberger, the creator of the Eisner-nominated Post York.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;In A Glass Grotesquely&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A suite of related short mysteries and thrills, all depicted in Sala&amp;rsquo;s trademark colorful watercolor washes and sharp, detailed line-work. Rising from the crumbling pages of some forgotten (and nonexistent) pulp magazine comes the diabolical villain Super-Enigmatix. Following in the bloody footsteps of master criminals such as Fantomas, Fu Manchu, or Professor Moriarty, Super-Enigmatix is ruthless, cunning, and thoroughly evil. His only goal is to spread fear and cause chaos - but does he want to destroy civilization, or save it? Not even his loyal army of female commandos can guess his real motives, or his true identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard Sala&amp;rsquo;s books are &amp;ldquo;deliriously entertaining&amp;rdquo; (Rue Morgue Magazine), &amp;ldquo;cinematic and cheerfully over-the-top&amp;rdquo; (The New York Times Book Review), containing &amp;ldquo;brilliantly atmospheric art, full of shadows and spikes.&amp;rdquo; (Booklist)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Mother, Come Home&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mother, Come Home is Paul Hornschemeier&amp;rsquo;s piercing graphic-novel debut. It secured the cartoonist&amp;rsquo;s place as one of his generation&amp;rsquo;s most skillful and ambitious practitioners; and proved a harbinger of the subject matter that the artist would go on to explore most consistently in later work: the nuclear family. Mother, Come Home quietly studies the inner lives of recently widowed David and his 7-year-old son, Thomas; both are unable to deal with their grief directly. Eisner-, Harvey-, and Ignatz-Award-nominated Hornschemeier&amp;rsquo;s controlled brushwork is clean, and his nine-panel page layouts pace David&amp;rsquo;s inexorable descent into utter despair. Hornschemeier is equally precise when it comes to Mother, Come Home&amp;rsquo;s color palette: subdued but warm, which suits the story&amp;rsquo;s melancholy and contemplative mode. Mother, Come Home is masterfully drawn; a powerful work with universal themes of anguish and loss.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The Sanctuary&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Nate Neal&amp;rsquo;s first full length graphic novel, the author explores the primal mysteries and sordid inner workings of a Paleolithic cave-dwelling tribe, creating an original &amp;ldquo;silent&amp;rdquo; reading experience by using symbols instead of words. When a mysterious nomad girl is offered up as an item of trade, she seeks refuge by forming a tenacious friendship with the local cave-painter turned outcast. Together they set out on a dangerous mission to bring truth to their corrupt tribe with the help of their new discovery (via some psychotropic mushrooms): drawings that tell a story. Subsequently, they become enmeshed in the violent power struggles and sensual intrigues between the alpha males and alpha females.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
