&lt;p&gt;Berezina&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1812, in order to keep his stranglehold on Europe, Napoleon had no choice but to declare war on the Russian emperor, Alexander. After three months of marching, his men, starved and exhausted, finally made it to Moscow&amp;hellip; only to discover that the city had been deserted. Thus Napoleon and his army took up residence in the Russian capital without even the slightest resistance. But by nightfall, Moscow was on fire. Houses, churches and even the Kremlin were ablaze, and the entire French army risked being reduced to ashes. Caught in the trap, Napoleon was forced to leave the city and get back on the road to face his enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE PERINEUM TECHNIQUE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JH meets Sarah on a dating site. They connect on a regular basis and bring each other to mutual on-screen orgasm. Their exchanges, brief and solitary, eventually obsess JH, who tries to convince Sarah to meet him in person. A strange game of seduction is established between them that compels JH to meet the one sexual challenge – abstinence – that might set something into motion with Sarah. This story is a loose and contemporary variation on the theme of seduction and the emergence of love during this time of hyperconnectivity. Playing skillfully with sexual metaphor and the deafening presence of what is implicit but never spoken, Florent Ruppert and Jérôme Mulot invite us to follow them into a maze of games of love and chance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;LIMITED EDITION&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Claire is a thirtysomething neonatal nurse who is becoming increasingly discouraged about her prospects of getting into a long-term relationship and starting a family. She thinks she may have finally met her man in Franck—if not a Prince Charming then at least a friendly and compatible person—but societal pressures and gender norms seem to rear their heads at every turn and Claire begins to wonder if it will ever be possible for her to be happy with another person on her own terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aude Picault’s chronicle of everyday romance is full of wit and sympathy but it is also backed up by a bibliography of feminist essays and studies of gender relations, offering a valuable and complicated case study of the challenges facing modern women.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He then discovers that the sexy young woman he&amp;rsquo;s just met has a tattoo of a strange, winged creature on her back.

&lt;p&gt;In the moment&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In the Moment&amp;rdquo; is a modern Romeo and Juliet in two different time dimensions. In this unusual love story, Dutch author Hanco Kolk and Flemish author Kim Duchateau have found a particular way of working together, in which each of them draws one time dimension. Rafael Falstaff falls hopelessly in love with Sylvia, a chronowoman. He can see her, but he doesn&amp;rsquo;t see her move, nor can he touch her, because they would both die if he did. But he&amp;rsquo;s happy with just seeing her, until he realizes her life is in danger. He then decides to take action, with all that it entails&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;In a world where meat means survival, Frank can&amp;rsquo;t seem to catch a break—or an animal. He just can&amp;rsquo;t bring himself to kill a fellow creature. Just looking into a baby mammoth&amp;rsquo;s big eyes is enough to turn him vegetarian. But while out looking for fruit to eat, he runs afoul of an old nemesis: the wily Leonard, who once stole his Swiss Army knife (and is still puzzling over it). Will Frank&amp;rsquo;s new mammoth friend save him from Leonard&amp;rsquo;s clutches? Will Leonard save them all from the common cold? And just why is their forbidden fruit forbidden?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;It all starts in a school playground, and then it moves to a classroom, where Larcenet&amp;rsquo;s superb graphic camera zooms in on two ten-year-old kids: Gildas and Martina. The pair of them are ever so slightly obsessed with Sci-fi. To the extent they think they&amp;rsquo;re surrounded by robots and aliens. As far as they&amp;rsquo;re concerned, their entire world is made up of false appearances, and they&amp;rsquo;re soon to be the victims of a huge intergalactic plot! You read, you smile, you snigger.

&lt;p&gt;It’s been a long, cold winter, and the Vikings are suffering major food shortages. Many of the men have left on a long voyage. In their absence, Björn, son of the village chief, Gandalf-the-mad, has been left in charge. Which is not good news for Thorgal, a young skald of mysterious origins, marginalized by the Viking tribe. Lucky for him, he has the beautiful Aaricia to look out for him. When Thorgal’s singing attracts three whales into the bay, the villagers hope they might finally be able to feed themselves. But something tells Thorgal that these are no ordinary whales…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;During the 1851 Great Exhibition in London, two women&amp;rsquo;s lives become irrevocably intertwined when they both fall victim to a nefarious underground fraternity of ex-soldiers from England&amp;rsquo;s upper crust who have sworn their lives to defending the British Empire—as well as their own decadent lifestyles. In this first volume, young rebel Jennifer Winterfield and the mysterious Kitamakura from Japan forge an unlikely alliance along with Jennifer&amp;rsquo;s doctor uncle and a street urchin named Pickles. Together they lay the groundwork for a criminal organization that will go on to sow terror in the hearts of the colonialists and industrialists who tried to put them down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vizilsan is a world hemmed by dreams. Full of contrast, reminiscent of a world from a time long forgotten, yet blessed with certain technological accomplishments from a distant future. The lines between magic and science are blurred. The vast diversity of races poses the question of their origin – either from another planet or a different time. It is a wonderful world of dense forests, endless rivers, vast oceans, insurmountable mountain tops, arid deserts. A world full of life. Alas, the energy that once maintained this natural balance has begun wandering aimlessly due to crazed exploitation of natural resources, threatening to destroy that world. Few are aware. Few are trying to do something about it. A human duchess and a battle-hardened kaitian warrior, with the help of a few loyal friends, will try to restore the balance to the world and secure its survival. An epic adventure across the five continents of the world of Vizilsan now begins&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The World Book of Records&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Egg-balancing, hotdog-eating, baton-twirling—these are a few of the records people try to break in order to find themselves included in the World Book of Records. For those who make into the book, Paul Baron, a judge at the publication, is a hero. For others, whose dreams he denies, he&amp;rsquo;s a villain. After one man&amp;rsquo;s plan to achieve renown is destroyed, Paul learns that the man may have lost everything else, but he hasn&amp;rsquo;t lost hope—the hope of joining other record-breakers in the book. But the record the man hopes to break is terrible, and Paul unfortunately has a role in his project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;March 1932, New York. Dan Shackelton is an Irish migrant. Like many of his fellow countrymen, he has found work on the construction site of the Rockefeller Center. He is to replace Ryan Murphy, a worker who died on the site. Dan works with a quiet, broad-shouldered man named Giant who is in charge of informing Ryan Murphy’s family of the news. But Giant decides not to say anything. Instead, he sends a substantial sum of money accompanied by an unsigned, typewritten letter. When he receives a response from Ryan’s widow, Mary Ann, Giant writes to her again, tangling himself up in a web of lies. Little by little, the enigmatic Giant starts to come out of his shell, until one day, when Mary Ann shows up in New York with her two children, ready to join her husband.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The Forgotten Slaves of Tromelin&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This story takes place on a tiny, far-flung island in the middle of the Indian Ocean, whose nearest neighbor is Madagascar, 500 kilometers away&amp;hellip; In 1760, the Utile, a ship carrying black slaves from Africa, was shipwrecked here and abandoned by her crew. The surviving slaves had to struggle to stay alive in this desolate land for fifteen years&amp;hellip; When this tale got back to France, it became the cornerstone of the battle of Enlightenment to outlaw slavery. More than two hundred years later, the artist Sylvain Savoia accompanied the first archeological mission in search of understanding how these men and women, who had come from the high mountains of Madagascar, had survived alone in the middle of the ocean. This is the story of that mission, through which we&amp;rsquo;re exposed to the extraordinary story of the slaves themselves.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Princess Natty of Orchidhali is a member of the floral caste and lives in a luxurious, sunshine-filled palace covered. Had she not neglected her studies of sacred texts and tradition, she&amp;rsquo;d have learned that refusing all of candidates presented to her for marriage would result in her death! She is forced to flee her palace and ends up in the dark realm of the Untouchables, the very lowest caste of society, where a strange form of leprosy reigns. One of the Untouchables, Sami, doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to suffer as badly as the others. As Natty develops a friendship with Sami, she discovers that he owes his relative beauty to his activity as a mushroom trafficker. In exchange for the valuable fungi, Sami obtains time exposed to the sun: in fact, it is the complete absence of sun from the Untouchables&amp;rsquo; realm that leads to their deformed bodies and skin. Together, Sami and Natty make a plan to leave the shadows of the underworld and return to the light. But just as they are about to make their escape, a battalion of soldiers arrives&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

Life is just as ferocious outside the arena. Everyone wants the power; everyone is willing to kill to get it&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Agrippina, Claudius&amp;rsquo; second wife, her dear husband has served his purpose. Now that he has acknowledged her son, Nero, as his heir, it&amp;rsquo;s high time he disappeared.

But there are some surprises in store for Romeo during his visit. He changes his mind about a few things, perhaps thanks to his grandfather&amp;rsquo;s neighbor, Lucy, who tells him about her own &amp;ldquo;nono,&amp;rdquo; and shows him how a spoil tip can be a thing of beauty. Or perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s thanks to Romeo&amp;rsquo;s dad, who speaks for the first time about his childhood relationship with his father. But it&amp;rsquo;s mostly thanks to Ottavio who, beneath his old, grouchy exterior, conceals the hard life he has led, full of suffering and sacrifice. It is a life the 11-year-old Romeo finds hard to comprehend, but which gives him a deeper understanding of someone from another century. It started off as just a short holiday to a grey Belgian town. But this holiday turns into an opportunity for three generations of men to lift the silence that surrounds them. A touching story about Italian immigration, coal mining, communication between the generations and the difficultly of opening up when you&amp;rsquo;ve spent your whole life in silence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Human Stock Exchange&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This opening episode of H.$.E presents us a world in the midst of an unprecedented financial crisis. Still, although the economy of industrialized countries is in tatters, unemployment has rocketed and millions of small business have gone bankrupt, there does seem to be one thing maintaining its financial value: the human being. Members of the social elite can have themselves listed on the stock market. So the stock market is no longer exclusively the privilege of corporate bodies, but of individual human bodies too! They can collect capital by wearing a &amp;ldquo;rate watch&amp;rdquo; indicating their popularity ratings. Felix Fox needs money. He wants one thing and one thing only: to get listed. After much persuasion, he finally gets there. With the backing of the creator of the Human Stock Exchange, he sits back and watches as his ratings soar. But of course, there is always a price to pay&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Gypsy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This first volume of the six-part series introduces us to the crazy world of the orphaned Tsagoi (aka Gypsy) and his little sister, Oblivia. After swearing to himself and Oblivia that he&amp;rsquo;d find a way to make his fortune and get them both out of their down-and-out beginnings, Tsagoi disappears from Oblivia&amp;rsquo;s life for the next 12 years. The only contact Oblivia has with her roguishly handsome big brother are the money packages he sends in order to pay for her expensive boarding school in Switzerland that he has her enrolled in. And she was just fine with that&amp;hellip; right up until the money runs out. Oblivia is left with no choice but to seek out her brother in Port Radium, where the pair embarks (against Oblivia&amp;rsquo;s will) on one of Tsagoi&amp;rsquo;s totally illegal money-making ventures. Living within the confines of Tsagoi&amp;rsquo;s trusty truck, the modern-day Gypsy&amp;rsquo;s caravan, Oblivia is forced to face up to the reality of what her brother has become: not the noble benefactor she had hoped for, but a first-rate scoundrel!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a dramatic graphic novel because it is about life. This is romance, because there is love. This is crime, because it&amp;rsquo;s about mysterious death. It&amp;rsquo;s also a graphic novel about dreams, because there is a lot of sleep in it. Come Back to Me Again is an emotional journey into yourself. This diary of feelings jagged by addiction. Alcohol addiction. Drug addiction. Love addiction. And life addiction. This story is about the continuous falling asleep and waking up. About daydreaming and life without sleep.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;A Love for the Ages&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jean and Germaine are the most affable couple the little village of Colle sur Loup has ever seen. A duke married to a commoner, they have no children, no jobs, and are disastrous cooks! They like to indulge in life&amp;rsquo;s small pleasures; their books, their garden, and their after-lunch naps. They live for each other, and for their love. Their simple happiness intrigues, fascinates, infuriates and is the envy of all those around them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniel Pennac knew Jean and Germaine well. He spent his time at their house reading, watching, learning, and, of course, trying Germaine&amp;rsquo;s catastrophic efforts in the kitchen! He&amp;rsquo;s now taken it upon himself to tell the story of those happy days, and of a love that has always captivated him.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Livid, Antoine jumps in his car and heads for Italy with revenge on his mind, his two buddies and his pregnant granddaughter following close behind. A chance to reminisce about the past, to fantasize about sticking it to the man, to discuss what&amp;rsquo;s wrong with the world, to bridge the generation gap, to forgive and forget and settle scores.

&lt;p&gt;Pablo Escobar is widely considered to have been the most successful criminal in history and to have invented modern-day drug trafficking. At the height of his career, the Columbian kingpin was making one million dollars a day smuggling cocaine into the U.S. Here is the tale of El Patrón, folk hero to some, public enemy number one to others, doting father and family man, ruthless murderer and an outlaw like no other. In part one, he surrenders to authorities and is “incarcerated” at La Catedral, where he enjoys the good life while frustrated U.S. intelligence agents plot to bring him down.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Gloria Victis&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a time when certain mortals could become gods. At this time, two thousand years ago, men would pass into legend by risking their lives to entertain the crowds; famous charioteers who, perched on their chariots like Apollo, would fight for their lives and their honor in the arena. This is the story of one of those heroes: Aelio Hermeros, perhaps one of the greates chariot riders of all time. He was a mortal immortalized in the memory of those who saw him compete, who witnessed his defeats, his victories, his blood spilled and, most of all, his glory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pythia lives in Delphi, in Ancient Greece, and between her classes at high school and her part-time job at the temple of Apollo, she leads quite a normal, boring life&amp;hellip; until the day that she refuses Apollo&amp;rsquo;s advances and he places upon her a terrible curse. She is now able to predict the future, but whenever she sees a catastrophic event on the horizon, no one believes her warnings and she is helpless to stop it from taking place. However, her new skills draw the interest some of the highest authorities: Zeus, the king of the Gods, entrusts her with a mission. Zeus has fathered yet another bastard child, a boy named Xanthos, and his wife Hera is on the war path. Wherever Xanthos goes, she rains down misfortunes and disasters, but maybe Pythia&amp;rsquo;s prophecies could help the arrogant young Xanthos to survive the wrath of Hera.&lt;/p&gt;

A world Irish boxer Jack Doyle is reluctantly drawn back to, to settle old scores.

&lt;p&gt;In search of Peter Pan&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the late 1920s, Melvin Z. Woodworth is an author with writer&amp;rsquo;s block and a mystery to solve. He takes a vacation to the Swiss Alps to try and kill two birds with one stone—and do some excellent hiking and skiing while he&amp;rsquo;s at it. But the little village, so long slumbering on the wrong side of the Industrial Revolution, is threatened by a force of nature—and, of course, contains secrets of its own. Cosey&amp;rsquo;s masterful graphic novel is presented here in full-color English translation for the first time: an ode to nature, culture, mythology, and a simpler—yet riskier—time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Sword Master&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s 1537. Deep in the lost mountains of Jura, a group of fanatical Catholic mountain people track a young Protestant and his guide. Big mistake. The latter is no other than the ex master-at-arms of Francois I, Hans Stalhoffer. After being defeated in an unfair fight, Hans had decided to exile himself from the court. Some years later, the surgeon that saved his life and his young apprentice ask for his help. They wish to travel undercover to Switzerland to publish the Bible in French. The only possible route is to take the infamous Jura Pass.

&lt;p&gt;Roger and His Humans&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things look like they might be starting to turn around for thirty-odd year old no-hoper Hugo, when he finds a robot in his house on his birthday. But, as he soon discovers, this is no birthday present (no one seems to have remembered to get him anything!), but the handiwork of his cousin, an engineer in the French army, who realized that the robot he had been building was designed to destroy humanity. Forced to hide out with Hugo, Roger – as he decides to call himself – must learn to live with humans&amp;hellip; No mean feat!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

With one little exception: Nathan is a ghost&amp;hellip; How did Nathan die? Why can only Louca see him? Will Nathan manage to turn Louca into the kind of guy people want to be with?

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s 1945. Floyd Whitman discovers that &amp;lsquo;those scumbag communists&amp;rsquo; have killed his father. He&amp;rsquo;s just a child, but he resolves to one day join the CIA. By 2003, America has triumphed over the Soviet Union, but the Russian mafia has become the most powerful, and certainly the most violent criminal group throughout the whole country. Through the fate of one man&amp;ndash;young and full of illusions in 1965, but rather more embittered in 2003&amp;ndash;we see the CIA help the Russian mafia get back on its feet in the squalid back rooms of the American empire. A great spy adventure comparable with the best of Hollywood thrillers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What exactly is a harem for? For the pleasure of a sovereign, of course. But he would be foolish to limit it to this sole purpose. They say that if you can satisfy a man, he&amp;rsquo;ll give you all the treasures of the earth. Including the spoils of war. Sultan Murati&amp;rsquo;s harem is a far more powerful weapon than the British and German armies, both of which are seeking his alliance. The flower of all flowers, the weapon of all weapons, Jade, the Sultan&amp;rsquo;s new favorite, is entrusted with the Sultan&amp;rsquo;s scheme to launch an assault on an English diplomat. A model of British calm and impregnability, like all men, Lord Nelson has his Achilles&amp;rsquo; heel: his wife&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allow us to introduce Olympia, an exquisite young woman living in post-First-World-War Berlin, a time when the town was continually shaken up by internal revolutions and cultural turbulence. Olympia is beautiful. Louise Brooks-style beautiful. She is the archetype of that generation of war-women, the likes of which we&amp;rsquo;ll never see again. Her father, Count Van Den Golzt, sends his daughter to Berlin following the Bolsheviks&amp;rsquo; establishment in Courlande, a move that he knew was a threat to the safety of his family. She soon becomes a fascinating character, with lovers from all walks of life, from bespectacled Communist intellectuals, to pimps. Alongside her decadent lifestyle, she fights passionately for the Socialist cause. Nihilistic, but driven, she ends up in the arms of the most unlikely suitor.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Esteban&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Esteban, a young Native American boy of just 12-years-old, presents himself to the captain of the Leviathan for the post of &amp;lsquo;harpooner&amp;rsquo;, he&amp;rsquo;s the laughing stock of the whole crew. But when the captain finds out that Esteban is the son of Suzanna of the Tehuelches tribe, he decides to take him on&amp;hellip; as ship&amp;rsquo;s boy. Despite his lowly post, this is Esteban&amp;rsquo;s chance to discover the sailor&amp;rsquo;s life, with all its hardship and its happiness, and maybe even a chance to prove what he&amp;rsquo;s made of!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ordinary Victories&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marco&amp;rsquo;s left town for the countryside. He&amp;rsquo;s left his psychologist because he feels he&amp;rsquo;s doing better. He&amp;rsquo;s quit his job as a reporter because he&amp;rsquo;s had enough of photographing corpses. He gets himself a little cottage in the heart of rural France, where he lives with his cat, Adolf. He throws out all his work, and cuts ties with his employer. That night, he has his first panic attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not long before he meets the lovely Emilie, and also the wise and good-natured old man who lives in the cottage just across the way&amp;hellip; but who, it turns out, isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly what he seems&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Desert Star&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our story starts in Washington, 1870. Matthew Montgomery has an important post at the Ministry of Defense. He&amp;rsquo;s rather an inflexible man who always respects the rules, which is why he warned his daughter, Helen, not to leave with that idiot, Glover. Of course, she did it anyway, and now she wants to come back and expects to be pardoned. But when Matthew arrives home the night of his Helen&amp;rsquo;s return, he opens the door to find his wife and daughter slaughtered in the hallway, and a strange star engraved on his daughter&amp;rsquo;s breast. His whole life is turned upside down. Traumatized, he starts out on the trail of the killers, with just one clue to help him on his way: a name - Jason Cauldry, from Topeka. Matthew wants to know why some stranger came such a long way just to etch that damn star onto his daughter&amp;rsquo;s body, so he sets off on a long journey, crossing the Appalachian mountains and the Mid-West, all the way to Topeka. But what will he find there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ken Games&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This first volume of the Ken Games series gives us a profile of Peter Fermat (aka Rock), a young man who, like each of the three main characters, is leading a double life. His story opens with a boxing match which has a nasty ending for the up-and-coming boxer, despite his victory. It&amp;rsquo;s not long before we discover that Rock is not only striving to make it in the boxing world, but is also something of a mathematical genius, which is how he met his best friend, TJ. For the first time in all their years of friendship, TJ introduces Rock to a girlfriend, the lovely Anne. Anne and Rock soon establish a bond of trust when Rock discovers that Anne too is living a double life, even though Anne&amp;rsquo;s secret is not exactly what she leads Rock to believe. This is just the beginning of the tangled web of lies and deception that gets ever more convoluted as the series goes on&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lethal Lullaby&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Telenko, a New York taxi driver, spends his days ferrying around the dregs of society in one of the city&amp;rsquo;s roughest neighborhoods. He has an obsessive fear of dying like a guy he saw in a film, who&amp;rsquo;d hear his heart stop every 15 beats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because Telenko himself has a tired heart. He has a minor case of tachycardia and the odd extra systole, not helped by his stressful job and the constant abuse from his wheelchair-bound wife, Martha: &amp;ldquo;You don&amp;rsquo;t divorce a wife in a wheelchair, Telenko!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She&amp;rsquo;ll get what&amp;rsquo;s coming to her, no doubt. Just like that slut who just got in his taxi who&amp;rsquo;s fooling around with some other guy right under her decrepit old husband&amp;rsquo;s nose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So he decides to kill Martha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you gotta have some guts to kill your wife in cold blood. Especially when she&amp;rsquo;s got a nasty surprise in store&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The Eagles of Rome&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategic general Drusus is entrusted with the mission of bringing the indomitable barbarians of Germania under the Roman Empire&amp;rsquo;s control. Once the battle is won, Prince Sigmar offers his son, Arminius, as a hostage to the Romans. Caesar consigns the education of the young barbarian to one of his most trusted companions, Titus Valerius Falco. Titus has a son of the same age as  Arminius, an unruly young man called Marcus, also in need of an education worthy of his name. Together, these two budding soldiers go through full training, and are time and again subjected to the steely discipline and harsh tests of their tutor, an ex-legionary. Through these trying experiences, the insolent young Roman and the hot-headed German gradually transform their reciprocal hatred into a strong friendship&amp;hellip; especially as they begin to discover the irresistible charms of their various female contemporaries&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Reprieve&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June 1943. Julien Sarlat jumps from the train transporting him to Germany and manages to get back to his small village in the Aveyron, Cambeyrac, where he hides, without the villagers&amp;rsquo; knowledge, to await the end of the hostilities. In a strange turn of fate, the train that he was on is bombed, and one of the corpses is identified as his. In the eyes of society, he is now dead. Taking advantage of this unexpected situation, he hides away in the attic of his old school teacher, who was arrested by the French Gestapo for suspected communist leanings. From that moment on Julien, from his observatory overlooking the village square, is the spectator of this everyday theater of ordinary people going about their business. Love, hatred, envy, cowardice, passion and heroism: the onlooker sees the most.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The White Sultana&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the story of two women. One of those women is Lady Sheringham, interviewed in her manor house, the other is Emma Piggott, who has just passed away in her London apartment, alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the former, life has been kind. She&amp;rsquo;s gone from Shanghai to Hong Kong to Kuala Lumpar, from governess to sultana. She lives in the lap of luxury, engaged in an endless cycle of drinks parties, outings on horseback and the delicious little scandals of the British colonial community. This is a woman destined never to know hardship, other than the loss of loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emma Piggott, a teacher at St. John&amp;rsquo;s, has lived a gray and stagnant life, experiencing Asia only through newspaper articles that she carefully cuts out collects, but never leaving the Whitechapel neighborhood where her parents kept a grocery store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, something unites these two women&amp;ndash;a little detail, nothing at all really, mere chance, or perhaps just a nightmare that troubles Lady Sheringham&amp;rsquo;s sleep from time to time&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s May 1809. Napolean&amp;rsquo;s great army is getting ready to cross the Danube on the immense floating bridge that they constructed overnight on the orders of the France&amp;rsquo;s most famous military genius. On the other side of the river, Archduke Charles and his Austrian army are waiting for them, determined to get their revenge for the humiliating defeat they suffered at Austerlitz.

&lt;p&gt;Muchacho&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1976 Nicaragua &amp;ldquo;Tacit&amp;rdquo; Somoza rules the small Central American country with the support of the ruthless Guardia. The son of a powerful family from the capital, Managua, Gabriel is a young priest with an incredible talent for sacred art. He is sent to enhance his painting skills with Ruben, a priest in San Juan&amp;ndash;a little village located at the base of a mountain. Despite his difficulty integrating with the villagers due to his father&amp;rsquo;s reputation, Gabriel slowly gets to know them and, eventually, to love them. Encouraged by Ruben, he paints the villagers. He paints them as they are&amp;ndash;men and women of flesh and blood. But Gabriel is soon witness to acts of military repression of the locals. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t take long for him and the villagers to get swept away in these times of growing rebellion and smoldering revolution. Artistic passion, romantic passion, revolutionary passion. Passion courses though the pages of Muchacho, a two-part series. Here is part one.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Agrippina&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agrippina, a wonderful prototype of the rebellious teenager, spends her time squabbling with her exasperated parents, determinately ignoring her infuriating brother, discussing the latest couplings with her girlfriends, studiously avoiding &amp;lsquo;being normal&amp;rsquo;, and falling madly in love with a different boy every two minutes. Quite simply hilarious.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Keepers of Lost Time&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keepers of Lost Time is a Serbian science-fiction comics trilogy wrriten by Miroslav Marić and drawn by Vujadin Radovanović. It is rightfully considered to be a significant work in the history of Serbian fantasy and comics. The first episode was published in 1990, the second in 2000, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t until 2012 that the trilogy finally saw its highly anticipated conclusion, published by Darkwood. This future-fantasy comic depicts two cultures – one of high technology, the other – tribal, in moments of their internal crises. They exist synchronously and interdependently, yet are in conflict due to their vastly different perceptions of the world and spiritual values.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Flora and the Shooting Stars&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;40-year-old Flora has just gone through a bitter divorce after 20 years of marriage. Thankfully, she can count on the support of her friends: Roxane, the cool hippie who loves to garden, Lea, the tireless career woman, and her old neighbor, Venerable. Like her friends, Flora would love to find her soul mate, but it&amp;rsquo;s just not that simple. She has several promising dates, but once the first flush of passion is over, her lovers seem to disappear into the night. Why does this keep happening? Is she not attractive enough? Is she so difficult to be around? Or is she being sabotaged by someone close to her? A story for the divorced (and perpetually single) 40-somethings who just want to take a moment to catch their breath, and maybe even enjoy their singledom, told through the eyes of Flora and her hilarious entourage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Diary of a Femen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FEMEN movement began in Ukraine in 2008. It has since spread throughout the world, as far as Spain, Sweden and Belgium. In France it really began to catch on when Inna Shevchenko arrived in Paris, where she sought asylum after she was deported from Ukraine. She took refuge in the &amp;ldquo;Lavoir Moderne Parisien&amp;rdquo; theatre, which has now become the training ground of FEMEN activists in France. This project is a fictional story based on real events and witness testimonies collected by the author, who has been in personal contact with FEMEN France for over 4 years. The aim is to study this social phenomenon and open up debate on the subject without taking sides or pronouncing judgment. The journal follows the story of a young French girl who, after a number of negative experiences connected to her social status as a woman in contemporary society, decides to join the movement. It&amp;rsquo;s not easy, and there will be consequences in her personal and professional life. She soon begins to question herself. A fascinating album that helps us understand the inner workings of the controversial feminist organization.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
